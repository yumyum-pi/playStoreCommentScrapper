Wynk,Govardhan Vasudev,3,65,"The offline songs need an internet connection to properly load. The offline list stops after a certain song and won't continue till I connect to the internet. It gets worse, for some apparent reason, when I connect to the internet, it shows that other offline songs are loading, even when the (actual) list has ended, a couple of songs are appearing twice. If I delete one of them, the other one gets deleted too."
Wynk,Dr Safarulla Hasanabba,4,589,"I have been using this app for a while now. Nice app, would recommend for others too. One suggetion, is it possible to know the number of hits for each song. So the listeners will get a fair idea which is the most viewed one in any category. Another thing is, do u have an option to repeat the songs within your favorite Playlist."
Wynk,Arun Kumar,1,44,"Sorting on downloaded songs - The sorting on downloaded songs never work as expected. For instance, when I sort using Date Added (either ascending or descending order), it never shows results as expected. The most frustrating thing is that my recently downloaded songs gets lost the the big list and jumbled up randomly.. I short, I can't find my songs in a very easy manner. Moreover, search for downloaded songs is also pathetic and very slow. SORTING OF SONGS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ISSUE WITH WYNK"
Wynk,Ramakrishnan P,4,149,"Hi team, For a previous version of wynk music, i have used equalizer. but with the new update I am not able to find the equalizer. Please add equalizer again. Other than that this is a superb music app."
Wynk,SAURABH CHOPRA,1,53,"This is the worst music app. It has lot of issues. First when call disconnects it doesn't start the music app. Second when you are at low internet connected zone, app doesn't play offline music, it searches for internet and maximum time stops automatically. Third when music was playing and you were on headphones, call connects and if you remove your headphones after that disconnect call, music starts playing rather then being stopped."
Wynk,Vikram Singh Rana,1,585,i am still sufring this app. i tried many time but still not open. may be some bugs are the problem please fix it as soon as possible.
Wynk,Vandit Jain,1,1,Total Trash as compared to other apps on market. Songs are not arranged alphabetically and the option provided is a real headache. My profile keeps resetting even after complaints to the developers. No night mode. No option to search for a song in your playlist. Really disappointing.
Wynk,NAKUL ARORA,5,69,Even after payment of the subscription fee it doesnt allow to use while you on international roaming. They even deny for refund. Why the hell did you take subscription fee then? useless fellows
Wynk,Avinash Singh,3,4,I'm a frequent user of airtel prepaid.. it's good that wynk is free for airtel users but there are many bugs we face... like i have a 2gb ram phone and whenever i play songs after a while the song stops.. and as i open wynk aap there's no option of playing music again for a while even if i close the app and reopen it.. so it's a request to airtel... if can. please fix this errors.. in other cases this is the best aap to listen free music
Wynk,Animesh Singh,1,2,"i fail to understand, why do you app makers want to control my phone, you want know my location that also precise one, you want to control my microphone, telephone storage, and to top it you want to read my phone's setting and change network connectivity. why? you are Just a music provider app just play you are an online music providet, just provide and take subscription charges.

Wynk,Sudish Nandeesh,4,21,"The latest update is making the whole UI lagging, even the whole phone. Tried clearing the app cache, restarting phone, everything i did. finally seeing the Wynk as culprit, whenever running in foreground or in background it is making whole UI lagging. Please check on this. Just before update it was running very smoothly."
Wynk,Hriday Purohit,3,2,The app has far too many glitches. Starts acting up on it's own. It's been like this for a while already. Lots and Lots of bugs. A good music app to use if it's bug and glitch free. or else I have to move to another music streaming app.
Wynk,Radhika Patil,1,3,Really bad service. i paid annual subscription twice still the app is not working. plus custemer care service is too bad. they prefer chatting rather than listening to the problem on call. its been 1 week i am trying to connect with them and get the solution.
Wynk,JACK SPARROW,2,2,"Its a nice app and like it but in rexent update it is asking for the access permission to Media, file and photos. I would like to know why it required to share my personal details to u. Pls advise. If its not resolved then i need to switch some other app."
Wynk,Arun TP,5,16,"very nice and best app for music lovers. The UI and daily updates are awesome. About Radio no words to describe. Suggestion is, some of the worlds best playlist are still missing in this app, kindly note down to add those too."
Wynk,WRINKLY LIPS,1,2,"For the past 4 months or so I'm not able to search anything due to the fact that the tap on the search icon doesn't register, not allowing me to input any kind of information. I hope this issue gets solved by the wink team."
Wynk,Pranta Gogoi,3,14,Music library for this app is great . but it is lacking in suggestions engine as per user and don't know why sound quality is not up to the mark even after playing on highest bitrate. same I have compared with other app .Much needed improvements on sound quality.
Wynk,Rakshith S Aradhya,5,503,best music app ever...! i get the latest songs here.......and that's so awesome...but wynk can add more songs like that of ADELE and you can add that sing along feature for more songs..!
Wynk,Dhananjay Waghela,3,3,App is free of cost but it gives too much advertisement as advertisement should at least come once or twice in one hour but it comes more than that and spoil the mood of listening song and also there are lack of instrumental songs. Sometimes instrumental songs gives peace to mind than hearing lyrics.
Wynk,Geetha Sakthi,5,7,I have been using this app for 2 years. This is the best music app I have ever used.There are various songs of different languages.I was used to many Hindi and English songs other than Tamil bcos I am a Tamilian.
Wynk,ani hebya,4,1,"i don't know why but most of the time this app interrupts while streaming songs.. 5min song can take around 15mins to complete, sometimes even more! I really confusing, which is bad either your APP or your #1 4G network!?!?"
Wynk,Keshav Agarwal,1,10,why do I have to give access to make phone calls for listening to music??? I understand it improves listening experience. But I don't want that experience at the cost of this permission. It should be my choice. I cannot enter the app without the permission. How I am suppose to access the Help and Support section without being able to open the app?

Wynk,Bedu,2,1,The App needs lots of improvements. It is automatically playing music and there is no option to turn this off in settings. Also Ads are occupying half of the screen.
Wynk,A Google user,2,4,"The only reason I use this app is because I'm an Airtel user & I get access to HD song quality(328kBps) plus offline songs. The overall experience of the app is terrible. It doesn't suggest a song, there's NO option to remove a suggested song & it keeps on playing the same songs over and over again. I listen songs on Spotify and download them here on Wynk. stupid app doesn't even have an option to shuffle playlists"
Wynk,Abhishek Kumar,1,,you don't have option to Set hello tune like JIO savan app facilitates JIO customer . the Hello tune services at airtel is very primitive and substandard. the wynk app is not devised with interface to set hello tune online . shame on you guys.
Wynk,Manoj Jangid,1,4,"bad, unable to auto connect, each time need to pair and on...... Elaborated below - we use it in the car. each time whenever we start the car it don't connect automatically via bluetooth, we need to on/off bluetooth and then pair each time.

Wynk,Sankar SV,4,3,"Good online music app for Airtel customers. However there are couple of issues. 1.Bluetooth Issue Whenever there is an interruption while listening on Bluetooth device through a call or if Bluetooth signal is lost&found. The ongoing song starts from the beginning again.Attimes its annoying while listening in car. 2. Once the current song which we played is over, an app created playlist starts playing.

Wynk,Aditya Chakravarty,2,46,"After the recent update, the app has stopped working. The Search Music, More options on the playlists etc all stopped working. So now, I am stuck with whatever music I have downloaded and can't explore more. I requested support via their chat help. It suggested the restrart method. After restart, now the Help and Support option is also not working. I guess if buying a premium account doesn't guarantee a properly working app, then I don't know what does."
Wynk,EviŁ Gaming,1,2,"The worst app I ever use, It functioned properly at first but after that whenever I tried to play offline songs from my playlist but It was not opening and this problem persists from the last update.😠😡😡"
Wynk,Kuljeet Singh Bedi,3,18,"while connected to the bluetooth in the car, it glitches everytime I get a call. I have to restart the app to make it play from the car speakers. apart from that the interface isn't that simple to get a hang of. the search feature needs to improve. the limit of 500 songs to a playlist when you press play all is annoying. it should be able to play all the songs in the playlist. note: this is a long term review and I have been using this app for 2 years now and it has improved a lot."
Wynk,Anubhav Srivastava,1,3,the app lags a lot and hangs frequently in my s9+.while scrolling the page lags a lot and ads which appear on page are frequently overlapping from one side to another.don't know whats wrong.very annoying music app
Wynk,Rampant Roads,3,32,"A very time efficient app. But when I downloaded some of the songs and played them, they worked for a week. However after that the app stopped responding and when I clicked play, the song would delete itself. I tried re-downloading the app but the same thing kept happening. I really wish u could fix this, because I really do love this app. 😊"

Great app. I am using Oppo Real Me; I don't know what has happened to Wynk it gets hang a lot. takes too much time in opening and app gets automatically closed. this is frustrating. i have also given permission to run the app in the background. @Wynk- i like this app and i think there should be some resolution for this issue. given 4 star. deducted one for the frustation m going thru.

Wynk,akanksha Chaudhary,4,,"It's an great app, you could probably find every song here. but it would be great if you could get lyrics along with the song."
Wynk,vishal dongare,1,1516,"I was using Wynk Music without subscription but when i tried to buy a monthly subscription for INR 100, during the payment money got deducted and i didn't got the subscription. So contacted Wynk Music Support asking for help that give me the monthly subscription or reverse the transaction. But even after continuously contacting Wynk music for three weeks the only thing they suggested is to wait as their technical team is working on this."
Wynk,Accha Khaneka DONN,5,,"I have been with Wynk for the last many years, always satiates my hunger for any kind of music from Ennio Morricone sahab to K L Saigal sahab....everybody I can think off."

Wynk,Bommu Bhavana,5,1734,"Its nice...but so many frustrating ads....and one more thing,Please add a ""SHUFFLE"" option for playing songs in a playlists.Cause listening to same order is really annoying sometimes and so is changing the order everytime..So please add an option to play songs in random order.It isnt that difficult right.Hope this will be considered.tq : - )"
Wynk,Kiran N,1,793,Wynk App is crashing within 30secs after opening the app. Upon contacting Wynk help and support team the only answer i got from past 3 months is to wait as the technical team is working on it. App works very occasionally and plays only the downloaded songs try any other options like search or play new song from suggestion it starts to crash and nothing works.
Wynk,Surabhi Mondal,5,69,"My experience was really nice.The good features are: 1.We can download the songs and listen them when no network connection. 2.We can also find the lyrics of the particular song in the option called 'more info (information)'. I really liked this aap. And guys if do agree with me please hit like. Thanks, Surabhi."
Wynk,Nellu Pagal,1,4,"Can't even play one song. Worst app ever experienced in my life. Waste of everything, time, MB & space. Ruined my mood. Coz of this useless app, my day is going bad..."
Wynk,Anam Tabassum,4,1,why won't it go to next song and I have to take the phone unlock it and click the next song button then it plays next song.
Wynk,Shouri Shanbhog,1,11,"I used to love Wynk. I don't know what happened, now it keeps crashing. So when I restart the app,the track has to be played from the beginning again. Very irritating. Updating, Reinstalling hasn't solved the glitch either."
Wynk,Neema Singh,5,,its a nice app but you could try something new by giving a different background color and some cool effects . It would ne the best app ( though it is the best ) if you give the feature of seeing the lyrics as well when the song is going on . According to me if these things are added Wynk music would be the most relaxing and enjoyable app a person has ever seen in the play store
Wynk,Mukesh Sharma,1,,Not do any type of search music not offline download and very type of touch issue. Very bad app worst app neede urgent repair app all issue. very bad airtel shame on u shame shame airtel.
Wynk,Raghu B P,1,1,"Airtel is a cheater, i purchased a song hoping i would get 320 kbps Quality but the skng i received is 128 kbps poor quality, the app promises 320 kbps songs but dont believe them. The support people are useless, they don't have a clue, i have waited for a month for the 320 kbps song, the funniest part is they are not even ready to refund the amount, even after acknowledging its a mistake on their part."
Wynk,Ashutosh Tiwari,3,,Best app for the music. There is a issue that the current play que is not in a alphabetical order even though I selected the option by song name.

Wynk,Govind PR,4,16,"Love the app.iv been a user of airtel for the past 6 years. one of airtels best perks is access to wynk premium. been using the app for quite a while. the new lyrics function was a much awaited feature. love the app. nothing to complain about.kudos to the app development team, but a smoother interface will be appreciated😋."
Wynk,Rajeer E K Mugal,2,2,"Ads are annoying, I hate this app. Please provide adfree experience for airtel users. Other providers are serving their customers well. UI is also laggy and difficult. Premium version rates are very high, so can't afford it."
Wynk,Senthil,2,,Why the app needs permission to make calls also for people only want to use online songs why storage media access required. Unnecessary mandate of permission is peeping to personal space.
Wynk,Indranil Bhattacharya,2,2,"1. very very, very poor navigation. 2. download songs gets removed automatically even when it is paid subscription. 3. searching of song is very cumbersome. this app has a huge database of collection 4. meta data of many songs incorrect and misleading. vast improvement in app experience required."
Wynk,Gopal Chandra Sen,1,,please remove the subscription and premium package from the aap. but u will not remove the subscription and premium package I am uninstall the aap after your update the aap was in no one position of garbage aaps

Whenever I play the downloaded songs which I added in my playlist also needs internet to load when I want to play it offline even if my playlist include only downloaded songs. please fix it as soon as possible
Wynk,prashant mahale,3,439,Deleting downloaded songs is very painful. Cannot delete the song while playing it or by searching it. cannot search a song from your library when offline. Will probably migrate to some other app after subscription expires.
Wynk,Rekha Kumari,2,5,"Well this app is exceptionally good. Perhaps, the quality of the voice and sound are not too clear. Though it's not too fascinating but satisfactory. After updating I found really good features."
Wynk,nykhilist,5,,what is the best thing of this app that crushes the compition is that it offers free music downloads and high quality listning without any monthly paid subscription . and that is totally super duper awesome . I've been using airtel from last 5 years ( personallly ) and i could say it had improved since then . totally dope ! #airtelthanks
Wynk,Rahul Jain,1,5,"They charged me 500 bucks despite of having a platinum number with Airtel. The app showed no charges to activate premium and the moment i selected paytm and confirmed, 500 rs got deducted. Now CS says that they cannot help. Pathetic service and commitment Wynk and Team Airtel."
Wynk,Mangesh Dere,3,2,"The app is ok for online song streaming. Issues I am facing these days. 1.The play pause next and prev buttons don't work when using Bluetooth earphone ( tried 2 Bluetooth earphones -sony, Jabra). 2. Song automatically stops playing without clicking on pause/stop. 3. Song keeps playing through phone speaker when the earphones are disconnected. (there are songs in the phone to stops playing songs once the earphones are disconnected then too this behavior) very disappointed with these issues."
Wynk,Riya,3,15,"love the app. however I'd like the option to add more than 500 songs in queue (as I have more than that downloaded.). I'd also like if you had more artists included (like avril lavigne's new music, Rex orange County etc) there should be an option to turn off recommended songs that's under the playing song. as much as I love recommendations I love listening to the songs I like without interruptions"
Wynk,Rahil Parekh,4,,"The new feature of providing lyrics is amazing. Also I request to provide lyrics of all songs (which isn't done yet, lots of songs are without lyrics). Even add more new songs which are just released, a lot of songs are still missing! Also improve the song quality."
Wynk,Vasanth Kumar,1,,I'm unable to download my purchased songs as mp3. I have reported this issue an year back and continuously following up. I just get one response. The team is still working. What a technically challenged team that must be! They are not even refunding my money!
Wynk,Dheepak Kumaar,1,13,The songs stop playing on their own and if you press play they start playing from the beginning again. I asked the customer care and they were of no help. I've even restarted my device and updated my app. 🤷🏻‍♂️. you kind of lose interest in the app after everything. Gaana should be better. I havent tried it yet.
Wynk,tenzin yingsel,1,1,"The app is not operating really well. if I want to search a song, I would type the song name and click the search icon but this isn't happening. I thought something was wrong with my phone. I logged out and logged in again but this is happening again. please fix this problem."

Wynk,Sandeep Kothari,1,5,There is no option not to repeat songs in Playlist. I want Wynk to stop playing once all songs in my Playlist have been played. You used to have this in older versions. Very disappointing.
Wynk,Harshit Bhasin,3,,"why can't I search any song in the search bar at the top? Nothing happens even I touch on Help and Support, fix this ASAP. If you cannot fix this, there are so many other options available on playstore. Don't ask me to write an email, you should know what to do."
Wynk,Sahil akhtar,2,,"on playing the offline songs, only the first song in the playlist plays after that it discontinues.. i cant play offline all downloaded songs.."
Wynk,Abdul rahiem,1,8,Not all Tamil songs are here in this app. Where is AR Rahmans Tamil songs from prema desam movie. Where is the artist chibz... Really dissatisfied using this app. This app doesn't give the fastest update... Tatiana Manois also not there in artist section...
Wynk,himasri lothugedda,1,4,After updating the app the lyrics of the song 🎶 on the player is not are not coming... The settings are proper there is no problem in settings.... If you don't display the lyrics why to show an update like this...

Wynk,Alisha Pace,1,6,"after the recent update, the app has stopped working. The more option on the playlists has stopped working. so now I'm stuck with whatever music I want to hear and can't explore more.

Wynk,Deepak Mittal,3,4,"Overall I feel that Ui is very confusing. Whenever i click on any song, it adds to song list while it should be play. if i want to add any song in queue then i suppose to option three dotted button over the song box."
Wynk,Bala Murugan,1,1,App is unnecessarily asking permission for managing calls in the phone. if not given app is not working. it means the app is downloading or using our privacy data without our knowledge. It is breech of data usage... App needs to be uninstalled immediately..... Pls be careful with this kind of app.....
Wynk,SharathChandra KHAMBHAMPATI,1,,lots of bugs. when online even doenloaded song plays through online. take a lot of time to play.
Wynk,Akshat Shah,4,12,The app is awesome. I have a suggestion for the app. Please add sort according to release date option in downloaded songs panel. If the geta reset then we have to download all the songs from unfinished panel. It so happens that during this process all the songs get shuffeled which is a bit annoying.
Wynk,Anmol kukreja,5,12,"The interface is good and everything else is perfectly fine. The only thing sucks is, i need to tap on equaliser each time when the song changes. Please fix this bug. i Can't keep on tapping it again and again to experience the equaliser sound. Thank you. Update: Everything is perfect now and I'm loving the new lyrics sync feature. thanks team wynk😍"

Wynk,Prateek Saxena,2,,it says unable to download song try again later. it was working fine till yesterday i got total 89 offline songs but now it says unable to diwnloas pls fix this.
Wynk,Uma Maheswari Mohanty,1,10,"Never saw an App more pathetic and buggy than this! Unending buffering and worst quality of music for the first few seconds even on high speed WiFi internet are the usual nonsense with this App. Now I got a coupon code for 12 months premium and when I want to change to premium version, the App never shows the premium plans or any option to upgrade. Each time I go to my subscriptions or upgrade option, it only shows the useless free version but no option to change it. Dumb brainless developers!"
Wynk,Vaibhav Kumar,1,12,I have been using the app for quite some time now and I liked it but all my downloaded songs got deleted just like that. It has happened before too and you guys said that it was a bug that was fixed but its happened again. Like seriously this is how you are going to run this app!!!!!!
Wynk,Rishabh Pal,3,4,the app is getting very very slow... it's taking a lot of time while changing a music and while opening the app do for the first time. kindly try to solve the issue.
Wynk,Arun Mokire,1,4,everyday morning when we first switch on the app.. within 1minute it stops... then again after about 10mins it again stops.. this is happebing every time. they have a useless customer service as they take ages to reply and there would be template reply as always that they are working on it and it will be corrected in next upgrade...
Wynk,radhika garg,1,,if there is a option to give negative i would have given a negative. the app ui is just distorting with disturbance as we move it up and down. how are the programmers there. such a big company and so much bugs. please get some good developers.

Wynk,Harsh Kashiwal,3,,"Try to improve your interface worst experience,try to create it like gaana aur spotify. The app is not smooth to use i use it on two different devices but again unexpected same experience Using app does not feel premium,feels like an app developed without using heart. User experience is important else evey thing is fine thankyou to respond"
Wynk,Yukti Gautam,3,6,This is good to know that you have added the feature of sing along! but it only works in hindi songs. Please add the same feature for english songs too!
Wynk,vikesh pandey,1,,no way to play all songs. it only plays 500 at a time. the playlist keeps playing the same song again n again even if u have kept shuffle on. the whole library is never imported in the player so u end up listening to the same list again n again.
Wynk,Pushpa Devi,3,6,Why the search option isn't working????!!!!! I tried uninstalling and installing but it didn't helped. Don't know what to do......??

Wynk,Pivoted Studio,3,1,"Low audio quality Everything is going well. But when you compare this app's sound quality with that of ""Gaana"" app, the audio experience is quite low even if you set the audio quality to HD I feel a little less in the audio quality."

Wynk,Abishek Haridas,1,9,"1. Why I should allow this app to make phone calls? I'm the only person who can make phone calls from my phone. 2. This is a mp3 music player, why I should allow this app to access my personal pictures, videos and files ?"
Wynk,Mohankumar Veeda,1,,Automatic deletion of my downloaded songs. You download all your favourite songs and keep them aside. Within few days all will be deleted without your notice. Funny app it could be a magic trick app rather than a music app. Disappointed..!
Wynk,Abhay Goel,4,4,Great content. One shortcoming is that it does not support android auto. I would have gladly given it 5 stars if it had android auto support like its contemporaries.
Wynk,Roshan Kanna,5,7,"I'm using wynk Music for one year in china. .. But i can download music in wynk.. Every time.. I can only download every quarter of the year..

Wynk,SUNNY KUMAR,1,6,The interface can be made less complicated. The player theme is an outdated one. Also why a ad comes if a airtel user who has a unlimited pack. Other companies provide a paid membership free along with the pack. There is no dark theme even. Extremely disappointed.
Wynk,chirag singh,5,26,"a very good music app.....all of my favourite songs are present here and it has many others as well. If you want to install a music app, i would recommend wynk music 😄"

Wynk,Reddy Bhuvan,1,,worest app. don't waste your time. i have already downloaded songs. but that songs not playing. it's playing the songs which ever their promoted. so no use. only for promotions this app is working for.
Wynk,Apoorva Hajela,1,,"My app has been malfunctioning for a while now. I changed my account name and saved it but it still shows the old name again and again. Also, the songs which i have downloaded are not accessible offline. Everytime that i contact the contact and support team to complaint about my issue, they tell me we're trying. Well it doesn't seem like. And even when i want the songs to be played in a particular sequence, they automatically gets played in shuffle mode, which is very frustrating."
Wynk,Aditya Khandekar,1,10,Please fix the app...does not work on college wifi. Also on mobile data it shows error while just streaming the songs. It is really irritating. PLEASE MAKE THE UI SMOOTH. PLEASEEE
Wynk,Veena Verma,2,3,Whenever I try to listen to music it just doesn't work!!!!! And to listen to offline music I need to click on some random songs before I click on the song I want to listen to make it work!!!! Plz improve and I will give you 5 stars 😑😑😑😒
Wynk,GAGAN POOJARY,3,,Not good as before.... The new update causing some problems.. like the quickness of the app is lost....
Wynk,Rosy Lance,5,,I love 2 use this app but paying money that's impossible my parents won't allow me 2 pay so pls change this I don't like this I can't download my favorite songs pls ya pls
Wynk,Sriram Iyer,1,9,"It used to be the best of the apps in the lot available. But now even after being a paid member, i face a lot of lagging in the app,( auto shutdowns and restarts) too frustrating having to set repeat if need be. The app has a lot of bug fixes to be done. and it lags both when online and while offline. I can learn patience handling this app and as well murder someone.. its that frustrating. Please look in to it."
Wynk,Kirtika Srivastava,1,,its very bad coz my subscription for 3 months is not activate..either u people refund the money or again activate my subscription..coz its very irritating
Wynk,A Google user,1,5,"Firstly I loved this app .. But now its being not supported in my android. It happened earlier too , in my other phones...... It seems like its crashing like anyrhing ... But you guys don't do anything... So please fix this problem.....🔎"
Wynk,Mandaar Vayal,2,6,I think wynk music should give lyrics option as free. It was free before some time. but now a days they are saying to take premium membership. I think they should give it free for atleast Airtel customers. As saavan is making free service for jio users wynk and Airtel should give this in free of cost. and I suggest to all airtel users give only 2 star to wynk music so that they will resume there service as it was before.
Wynk,Shashi kapoor,1,1,"nothing is playing even after an annual subscription is paid,it always says poor network,everything else is working fine but Wynk Music if this is not sorted out soon I would like my money back"

Wynk,Anuj Gupta,3,4,"Hi Team, I dont find a way to sort songs in the playlist I created. The only way available is to manually drag and drop the song. Please find a 'Sort By' option for custom playlist as well."
Wynk,Amit kumar majumdar,1,1,OYE WYNK... WHY ARE YOU ASKING CALL PERMISSION FOR WYNK MUSIC APP. FRAUD AIRTEL ALLOWS NONSENSE APPS TO COLLECT PERSONAL DETAILS TO RUN A FUDDU APP LIKE WYNK MUSIC. FOR MUSIC PLAYING YOU NEED STORAGE AND MUSIC PLAYER PERMISSION ONLY NOT THE MICROPHONE AND CALL PERMISSION. WYNK WILL COLLAPSE LIKE AIRTEL. BACHKE RAHO WYNK B.C. AIRTEL KE SATH MAT RAHO WARNA G.MARAOGE .
Wynk,Sameer Shah,5,10,"Best music app! Atter the addition of lyrics, this has become undoubtedly, unarguably the best music app. Great interface, easy navigation, awesome collections. Airtel has done amazing work in this app. I have been using this app since many years, happy to see the progress on it. Thank you and keep up the good work. :)"
Wynk,Syed Shajeer,1,,The application worked well until today from past 20 days.. The malfunction that disappoints I is the song while being played stops abruptly & the application closes on its own. Looking forward to have the issue resolved.. Thanks.
Wynk,Shivam Singh,1,10,App keeps on crashing. I can't even send feedback on Help & Support option in the app as it crashes when I'm halfway there. The app automatically closes within 2-3 seconds of playing any song. Tech team needs to look into this seriously.
Wynk,Dinesh RaviKumar,1,46,"After recent update, am not able to view the playlist that I created. Few times it is visible. Please check it out guys"

Wynk,Vani Arora,1,5,why we can't download song in free of cost???even offline song not able to play without net so what the use of download songs if they can't play offline🤔
Wynk,Muskaan Singh,1,5,This app used to be my favourite because I can download the songs even when I am offline now it's doesn't have that option even it's downloaded it doesn't work.... Very disappointed..
Wynk,Richard Owens,1,,Needs permissions to make and manage phone calls? Seriously???? Uninstalling.
Wynk,Anubhav Rout,5,,Its a good app for all the fans but there is one problem please expand your music library from around the world
Wynk,Chandu Prem,5,450,A functional and decent music app. I don't see anything going wrong for it. You can find all the mainstream songs. The quality is good.
Wynk,Mayank Gupta,2,9,"The app is good for songs you can find any song, but it always shows to redownload my downloaded songs. I have downloaded my playlist 5 times till now that's very bad. in case you don't have access to Internet you can't play even your playlist."
Wynk,Amisha Gurung,3,6,something is wrong with my wink. Every time I download the song it remains offline for few days and again goes back to download again. It's irritating to download the same song almost twice or thrice a month. please do something about it.
Wynk,Siddhartth Taara,1,1,"Unable to download songs, i have been using Wynk since many years as i am an Airtel customer. Until now, i was able to make the songs be available offline on my phone but now the app doesnot let me."
Wynk,hello hello,1,,"this is my third time reinstalling it and even after sending my complaint ,the app just doesnt work. how ae you supposed to listen to music if the play button doesnt work?"
Wynk,Krishna Lawaniya,5,,best of international and local songs easy downloaded without any of the issue you must chek it once for better music if u are music lover then you must download it once
Wynk,sanjay poojari,4,11,"When I am clicking the play button,its not playing anything,please fix it as soon as possible..."
Wynk,Aloof Akeelah,5,7,"This App is the best music App and provides a huge variety of English songs. loved it. I will like to say that please add more K-pop songs especially from BTS. Please Please Please. 💜💜💜. Thanks for adding Korean and Japanese songs. I will like to add that it will be great if you add Kashmiri songs from new and young artists like "" aadil gurezi and yawar afdal ""."
Wynk,suraj sonkar,1,,What a repsponce to a feedback. I pointed out that Equalizer did not work with bluetooth mode though it works fine with headphones. So instead of updating/upgrading your app you simply choose to delete my feedback...Vry Good Keep it up
Wynk,Baat Sunn,1,3,the search bar is not working the help and support is not opening.
Wynk,S Saleem,5,,awesome app we can search what ever the song is so I am to download this app thank you for making such a wonderful app so I gave 5 stars to this app
Wynk,Anusha Baskar,2,5,"I'm not able to use the search bar?? I keep clicking it but nothing happens! I restarted the phone, uninstalled and installed the app again, still doesn't work."
Wynk,Harmeet Singh,5,,it is a very good app but today it is not downloading songs even though network is fast. and also my previous downloaded songs have been removed by itself. I request you to please fix this as soon as possible.
Wynk,Arpita Kayal,2,,"i just downloaded it today but it is crashing repeatedly. i have uninstalled n installed again, yet same problem. i like the app.. please if it works properly none will be happier than me."
Wynk,Akshay Singh,1,1,"laggy as hell . elaboration is that it is just stops for a while, after clicking it doesn't take the effect immediately."
Wynk,sunil nag,2,11,I hate this app now. previously it was good. Now too many adds. Some random songs will play even if I select from my playlist. Too much lag these days(Not my network issue it's application issue). I'm going to uninstall this now.
Wynk,Appalanaidu Ganta,5,,really it's an awesome app...and it is better than other apps because we can download the songs freely but there is one default that is i am not getting the lyrics for punjabi songs so once you have to go through and check about it.
Wynk,Living Brat,1,,i cant find some songs...wynk has limited collection of songs... i cant set hello tunes from wynk for my airtel number .....poor airtel users
Gaana,shreyas joshi,3,145,great app. lots and lots of songs. their song groupings are not good though. so you play a group then there are a few good songs in it among a bunch of mediocre ones in each genera. reduced star rating because it stops playing on Bluetooth for few minutes after every few songs.
Gaana,Gourav Sharma,1,99,"Just about the live icc wc 2019 commentary, it is streaming in really a bad way. Please do something about it. It's really a useful feature but needed to be improved. else gaana is a 5 star app."
Gaana,Anurag Dixit,4,1899,"It was a very good experience with this app.I think in present day it is the best music app. But please add new releases song language wise like hindi, english ,punjabi separately"
Gaana,GIRI KESAPRAGADA,1,1101,Download is not proper. Sometimes downloaded songs are also automatically erased. Download order is also not proper. How to use tutorial is also not available.
Gaana,Shivansh Thapliyal,2,63,Many latest (some somewhat old) and all NCS songs are missing. Song quality is not excellent either. I have its premium but I still uses Spotify.
Gaana,Yogesh Marwaha,3,291,Collection is good (mostly Hindi/Punjabi for me). UI feels cluttered. Connection with car's bluetooth receiver is not reliable; also doesn't show current position of song on receiver.
Gaana,Aritra Basak,3,34,It's all about okk... But whats's the problem with the equilizer option!!??? Why that facility was removed????? Plz include that facility again...
Gaana,Kanagasabai Kulandaivelu,5,123,"The app is just awesome and the music quality is mind blowing. just loving the app. . . ,👌👍"
Gaana,Mridula Kalita Dutta,4,191,"It's one of the best apps for online music. But for offline, I doubt this. While being under a subscription, I downloaded some songs (using mobile data; not free of cost), which have stopped playing offline, just 8 days before the end of the subscription. Instead, the message for renewing the subscription is coming. I am disappointed with the app. I am planning to not renew or even buy a subscription in the future. Come on, I wasted so much of my daily net pack for the downloads!!!"
Gaana,vrowmuria,2,121,"Good app, but sometimes not user friendly. Like, if you are playing a song and listening on headphone and switch off the display first time, the app also switchs off playing the song. This is annoying. Again you need to switch on the display and need to play the song again. Also at this point, the song needs to be start from starting again. This seems to be a bug. Search is, I would say, not weak, but very very stupid - You can't find a song that you played a month back and you forgot to save."
Gaana,Sayu Shirgaonkar,5,6923,"Certainly the best music apps of all time. You can arrange the sequence of your songs as per your will, download your favourite songs to access when offline, by heart the song with the aid of lyrics, know more about the song and the singers and much more. This app has undoubtedly enhanced my love for music and I guarantee that anyone who downloads this app will be obsessed with music. So music-lovers what are you waiting for? Download the app as soon as possible..."
Gaana,N Vatsyayan.,5,2953,Excellent app. It has various play lists. I'm literally in love with it. It can help you decide which song to listen to and I have discovered many great songs with gaana's help. I prefer English songs so I decided just to have my subscription for them only . There are a very few adds. It is very easy to use and time saving. There's no doubt that this app is one of the best music apps and is a must download...... We can discover the unlimited boundaries of music with gaana. It's a great app .....
Gaana,Nihal Phadtare,1,3119,"5 stars to 1 star. The update from past 2-3 months and the experience is horrible. So many many of glitches. The app crashes and has a mind of it's own. When I play offline songs from my internal storage, the app doesn't allow the chosen song to play sometimes it keeps on and on forwarding to the next song till I get frustrated and shut Down the app. No matter how premium smartphone you use this app will hang and makes you realize that something's wrong with your smartphone. I don't understand."
Gaana,Jay Unewal,5,116,Gaana has been always there on my phone. As there are always promotions going on for Gaana Premium every year I get a good deal while renewing my account. Apart from that I would like to have a feature using which I can switch between my devices without any hassle. I dont want to search for track which I am already playing on my one device to other. It's similar to Spotify. It would be great if you guys can get that feature soon.
Gaana,Jeeson Varghese,1,2212,"I am not satisfied with this app. most of the songs of my interest are not there. I cancelled my subscription to which i did not receive any refund. I contacted the agent to which he replied on the process of how to cancel the subscription which i am already aware of. I think they dont even read the queries entirely , what customer is asking for. I won't suggest anyone to subscribe anything from Gaana."
Gaana,Akshay Lad,4,176,The app is best for music and i'm an Gaana Plus user because i really like the Sound quality of the music in Ganna app. But from the last update the equalizers were introduced in that there is some sort of disturbance I'm facing. Can you guys please check the same? I hope it will be fixed in next update. This is the only thing which made me to rate the app for 4-star. Rest all is best for this app. Best UI. Best sound quality. Best Songs collection you can find all the songs in Gaana.
Gaana,Abhay Gupta,1,94,3rd class app. Hangs a lot in every phone. Music stops playing automatically. Recently I changed my phone. I had an account with this app which I continued to use in my new phone too. I saved my playlist and favorite songs in earlier phone. Now when I changed my phone everything is gone. There is no saved playlist no favorite songs...Nothing. Pathetic!!
Gaana,prateek Mishra,3,101,my experience with ganna is way worse. I am on a year long subscription. I lost the whole bunch of my downloaded songs twice in just one month of subscription. It takes lot of time and data as well to create a playlist of your favourite songs but these guys are just pathetic. Their customer support is literally sickening.They either don't reply to your query or will reply after 16-72hrs later. Please don't subscribe to this ganna. User experience is just very irritating. 🙁😟😕
Gaana,Sagar Kaul,1,103,"I am a premium subscriber but songs are stopping suddenly while playing. This is not acceptable and is happening quiet frequently. And, what is it with videos playing in some albums ? I dont understand if I had to watch videos I would have subscribed to youtube. If you guys are music application just stick to it. Such a DISSAPOINTMENT. I have a Galaxy s10."
Gaana,Praveen Negi,1,55,"dont buy the subscription. especially not when the app is such a terrible mess. it looks like I'm back on fb. Want to search music? not so easy mate, you go back to home instead of previous page so you have to search again. Want to play music? not so easy mate, it hides the buttons in 2s so you can't change or forward the song. Like to see album art? nah mate, you can't enjoy the album art as we crop it so you won't even know which movie's song this is. Never seen a music app as bad as gaana."
Gaana,Gagan Saini,5,746,Issue not fixed yet. Uninstalling app. I was a gaana+ user. Highly unsatisfied with the service. The app is crashing after screen lock or even on minimizing in Andorid P on pixel 2. Please fix. I am not able to use the app anymore. Issue still not fixed. Communicated via email also. This should be on your highest priority because the latest version of android can not run your application correctly.
Gaana,Kanishk Singh,3,9,"I loved the app earlier. In recent updates, it feels more cluttered, user experience has died down and the equalizer is worse than ever. Equalizer effect stays only till the current song lasts. When the next song plays, you have to go to settings and switch the equalizer again and there it gets horrible. You have to then pause the song and play again for equalizer effect to pitch in. The earlier equalizer was better I suppose, the native one. The new equaliser lacks User preferences as well."
Gaana,Shrikar Kulkarni,4,40,Overall it's a satisfactory experience. More songs can be added. easily the cheapest app for students with just 200 per year for premium account. really nice. But I have a complaint. There's a bug while Chromecasting which makes the current song playing never play properly after Chromecast is enabled. It is kinda annoying and hope it's fixed. Will give it a 5 star if it is fixed.
Gaana,A Google user,5,1092,"This is an amazing app for listening music and since I relax by listening music mostly so this is a great app for me and definitely for music-lovers... I would recommend you to all since you can hear latest music free and also it contains a login feature by which it keeps a record of your taste.... that's awesome! Though sometimes it crashes and lags (not so much, very less times) but I do not blame the app for this... might be my own phone. After all it deserves five stars absolutely;Excellent!"
Gaana,Upkar Dhaliwal,2,87,"please please fix the auto sync setting, it keeps turning itself, Actually to be more precise, why not maintain all the settings. even after the stupid 30 days deadline requirement, no Google or Apple or any reliable provider have this issues, have commented via email. but no interest to work with me.. update, this year I moved to an annual plan, but the app keeps trying to make an additional purchase on a monthly basis, had to write for past 5 .months to fix the situation, no luck, awesome"
Gaana,The Nirit,2,47,"App is very good and have huge amount of collection of reginal songs. But from the last few updates it doesnt working properly. Everytime i open the app and play some song audio will not play. Then i have to remove it from recent apps,force close it and then audio will be heard. due to this problem, have to repeat this procedure again n agin which makes it even worse. kindly look into this bug or problem and fix it as early as possible."
Gaana,Priya Sindkar,4,631,"The app is cool, I especially like the radio which saves me the trouble to select songs. There is a small bug that bugs ne every now and then- when I pause the app from notification drawer and later kill app from recents list, the notification doesn't go away and the music can be played again from play button. i have to manually force stop the app from settings. this should not be how it works, my battery consumptions increases this way. please have a look at this issue asap."
Gaana,Karthik gns Kasi,1,62,"After the latest update, the app stops frequently, like for every 2 or 3 songs it gets stopped, especially when listening via earphones! It happens on bluetooth also. Device:redmi note 5 pro. It's really irritating! Pls try to solve it ASAP! I've given all the required permissions for the app, yet the problem continues. I've been a long term user and this is effecting my user experience alot!"
Gaana,Yash Gaud,1,45,"Bad update! The update has spoilt everything good in the app. Where's the 'add to queue' option? Where is the 'play similar songs' option? Why kill good features in an update? Now when I click on a particular song it doesn't even play the entire list, only the song selected. Need to switch to another app. Suggestions anyone?"
Gaana,Mayank Purohit,1,104,Really loved this aap but recent updates have completely ruined the user experience. I was just trying to open the current album of the song I was playing but no matter what I did it wouldn't load the album. Sometimes it just stops playing randomly or skips to the next song. The app even glitches while playing songs from local memory.
Gaana,Rajesh,1,223,"What a stupid UX design.. When you click one of the song in album and playing, it's hard to get back to those list of album songs once you click back or home. Now they will be part your queue along with other unnecessary songs which you have played till now. How about learning something from your competitors? Dont get me started with that awful search functionality. REGRETED BUYING THIS."
Gaana,A Google user,4,60,"Best music app ever! Recommendations are great.But a few suggestions: the lyrics poster is good but pls also bring a feature to download the full song lyrics and info.I tried but found no lyrics downloading option. The new video feature is good 👍 . One more thing, I don't know why the song sometimes stops when I open something. pls do something about it."
Gaana,Ankit Srivastava,5,91,for people who are addicted to music this is there stuff. just a piece of advice if it is possible you can add a DJ feature where we can play the songs and mix them and take the party on the top . gaana music will become the most unique app which can get all the songs and play them using a DJ feature. just for the music vampires u know.
Gaana,CA Rahul Jain,3,40,"Great collection of songs. But lately facing the following issues,inspite of being a Plus user:- 1. Unable to add songs to Playlist 2. Unable to change the sequence of songs in a Playlist 3. Unable to download. Always shows ""Queued"". Storage of more than 50% available in my phone. Have both logged out & logged in AND Uninstalled and reinstalled so many times, besides updating to the latest version. But to no avail. Getting fed up of it now. Have so painfully created my Playlists. Pls sort this"
Gaana,Nitin Aggarwal,1,95,"It has so many bugs like t keeps running in background even after it has been closed. many times it automatically starts playing songs even if you don't want and sometimes reopening and closing app also doesn't fix that you will have to restart to fix it also Login with Google, Facebook or phone not working when you start using it for the first time and Google."
Gaana,Vishal Prajapati,1,165,"I am a gaana plus user and I have download my playlist, but when I play it, for most of the songs after some seconds of play, it just stops the playing song. in fact if i don't download the song it works fine. I should give up the plus and always use the mobile data mode, anyway we have lots of data available these days."
Gaana,Akshay Sachan,5,275,"Totally not happy with the fact that listening to a few songs consumed more than 4 GB of my mobile data in just 2 hours, with most of it being on the background. I think the new video feature is consuming lot of data even when the app is in background. I'll be happy to give more details. Please HELP AND FIX IT ASAP."
Gaana,sarthak agarwal,5,61,"the app is no doubt very good but one drawback of this app is that the app anyhow just crashes and stops working after being used for may be half an hour. one more thing, don't know why but the song thats being played on this app keeps pausing in between and its surely not because of slow internet speed(buffering). rest, this app is superb! i rate 4/5"
Gaana,Galz Rock!!,5,116,"I tried to turn off auto play, but it's not working. I am just tired listening to auto play songs. The auto play songs type don't match with the type of first song. For instance, I heard a sad song first, the auto play will play some party type songs. Now I have turned off that option, it is still not working. Still the auto play is working."
Gaana,Soumitra Trivedi,3,72,it use to be amazing before.... now you try to search for some songs literally 100 versions of that song are present but the original one is nowhere to be found. gaana people should work on their search engine to make it more pinpoint and precise.... searching for any song is getting more and more annoying... Overall for this app (apart from search thing) It certainly deserves a 5 star....it is an awesome app.
Gaana,Latent Talent. M. 6 mn. MCNNo,1,102,Do not waste money installing this app if u think u can download and listen to music offline. No !! Its a hogwash to show that its downloaded to ur phone but all it creates is a fav link. Not too many choices for music. seems like they are starved for funds. Quite natural... it is a terrible product.
Gaana,Upendra Poudel,3,131,i was going through reviews and all the issue of users like me and turns out you guys are terrible at fixing problems with your app. Recently i bought the subscription after giving it a try and i was impressed but now after making my playlist and downloading songs boom i cant login anymore like seriously!!?? having numerous database of songs is not the way to run the app and company please fix the issues with logging in and other issues with so many subscriber.
Gaana,amit495,1,41,"Really bad interface. Also after playing the play list, gaana will start playing its predefined play list and in the exact same order. This is done irrespective of the fact that you have selected the play list to be on repeat and not the gaana's predefined list. The music quality on gaana is much inferior as compared to others like Amazon music. I've tried changing equaliser but still gaana is not able to produce same beats for same songs even while playing at the highest quality."
Gaana,Rupan Samanta,5,1,Amazing app for listening to your favorite music with lyrics just 💕💕 this app . Thank to the team for making this app.
Gaana,A Google user,5,49,"it's amazingly beautiful.. i love this app really💝its my personal experience .this is just like that you love. if you download this app then definitely you will enjoy this application aslo there features . You can get here all types of songs, bhajans,raps, Disco songs,sad songs,etc with lyrics it's available on this app . so download this app soon and experience it seriously it's lovely👍❤️"
Gaana,Neeraj Chaudhary,1,52,"even after having paid subscription there customer support never responds. in last 3 months i had sent atleast 10 queries and they did not even bother to respond even a sibgle query. all these requests were made from settings-help option inside the app. 1. App crashes Everytime i cast the song to Chromecast and lock my phone. it never plays the next song. i have to ooen the app again and play. i am using pixel 3. 2. On android car, there is no option to shuffle my downloaded songs. 500 limit"
Gaana,Dhiraj Thakur,4,46,This new update screwed my experience with it. I have been using it since i can't even recall. now it is too flooded with ads like bunch of other apps. Its was the only app that used to play song without having to show ad first. now i can switch to any music app as all have became the ad world.
Gaana,Shubham Bhatt,4,25,"This app isn't smart actually. It doesn't remember the steps. Once i play a song after looking for an artist and then back to the menu to search more songs from same artist. It gets back altogether and brings us to homepage. Extremely poor, the songs aren't filtered by actors too which comes down as a negtive for SRK, Salman, Hrithik etc. Song quality is good but these minute cum important things have let you down."
Gaana,Prateek Toppo,3,87,"The UI is still quite buggy and not user friendly. Navigating through songs and playlists is a chore. Most of the lyrics to the songs have lines missing. The feature to look up similar songs is so painful to use. I understand these are ancillary features, and it still iis a great app for streaming and downloading music. I've been loyal to this app for more than a year and half now. Hope these little bugs can be rectified before my current subscription expires."
Gaana,Dhruvin Bhatt,5,29,"Bas bajna chahiye gaana. And this is proven by this app. Gaana is the best online music app, and it has proven its worth. The playlists are well organized and well categorized. The best thing is Radio. Gaana has the most vivid radio features among all apps that I have seen. Even the mood radio is there, and radio for all events, like party, workout, prayer, romance, chill, everything is here. I am continuously listening to gaana, and the playlists auto shuffled in its radio, never bores me. 💗💗"
Gaana,Mohit Bhavsar,1,48,"Sound is too loud. Try pause and play u can get difference in sound quality. I raised this issue multiple times. But not acknowledge by them. Its too irritating if like loud songs. Better I won't subscribe this app anymore again. Also got reply pathetic reply fron them by saying that ""We suggest u to use it without equilizer."" Also having below questions : What is use of equilizer option? And why it works well with other applications but not gaana?"
Gaana,Piyush Vaishnav,2,111,"Being Gaana+ user, it crashes application many times. I'm using Lenovo,they provide Dolby Atmos. While I'm heading to to change the settings, I open, Dolby automatically works stop, give along option with system too. And equalizer not works at all. And also remove video while we listening to respective song. We don't want for that YouTube is best for video. So, you deserve only 2 star from my side, Thanks!"
Gaana,Saurav Joshi,4,41,"Some of basic offline music player functionalities are not working . 1] Play next sequencing tab doesn't work offline. 2] If a song is selected manually to play while the playlist/songs are in Shuffle , the Shuffle feature gets disabled from that moment and songs play in the listed sequence , thus need to toggle Shuffle now and then. 3] If the app is closed while the song is halfway through or so .. after opening the app again the song isn't resumed instead starts over. Improve music player too."
Gaana,Saurabh Kulkarni,3,113,"Okay so the lyrics can now be disabled, but crossfade doesn't seem to work. Also, the UI is a bit janky, the library has an only ""okay"" amount of English content, and the recommendations are pretty bad. While the rest of the UI seems good, the homescreen feels cluttered, and I keep seeing songs in other languages even though I selected English as my default. Also, instead of putting a separate search button at the top, combine it with the voice search. Queue management is also bad."
Gaana,athikesh sree,5,135,"Actually it's a cool app. But I have been one issue. It is that when ever I go for any radio whether it is mirchi or international, I don't know but the app suddenly stops running. It suddenly returns to my home screen. That is it gets into app menu. I don't know why and how. Could u guys pls fix dis. And there is not music equiliser, I have to know whether it's my mobile problem or the app. If that's app's then pls add tat. Thanks for a good app."
Gaana,Nikhil Reddy Guda,1,53,Generall I love this app but recently it's automatically playing Panjabi songs out of nowhere and it doesn't show in the currently playing bar and they keep playing even after I close the app. Only two options I have in such cases is either to restart the mobile or uninstall the Gaana app. I don't think I would like to fo either of those every time I listen songs.
Gaana,Vivek Ji Baranwal,5,486,"Awesome download feature. Smart download is best. What I wish it to have the option to show the least played song. This way whenever I feel to release some space, I won't have to worry about my collection value. I don't wanna lose those songs that I love most."
Gaana,Vivek Yadav,1,171,It's good to have new equaliser live but it doesn't give the freedom to control bass and treble. Please bring back the stock equaliser option along with your new equaliser. Must needed feature. I took 1 year subscription just because gaana allows to use stock equaliser. But in this update you removed the freedom to use stock equaliser. New equaliser is not powerful no bass.
Gaana,Speedy Boi,2,64,"Lots of artists and songs missing. Equalizer randomly stops working. Gaana PC app doesn't support radio of a particular song. Artist and album organisation not so good (could be improved). Edit - new update made the equalizer worse. The manual setting is gone. The presets randomly boost and supress the audio, at times even start to stutter. Device - Redmi Note 4"
Gaana,sahil kamra,5,106,"Guys, you created a great application. But then I don't know what happened that I am unable to listen to any English song as it gives me this message - ""This song is not available in your region. Moving to the next song"". This is happening with every other language except the languages of Indian origin. If it is a bug then please fix it. You guys deserve 5 stars."
Gaana,prashant saroha,3,30,I think you should improve. 1.This app doesn't show lyrics for the songs I've stored in my phone. Why's that? 2. There are not appreciable suggestions from you on latest releases. 3.The way lyrics shown can be improved. 4. worst collection of songs and do not update it timely.
Gaana,Victor Sinha,1,20,It was my favorite music app.. but suddenly what happened i don't know.. I'm facing lots of problems.. it stops working or changing the songs automatically.. when i put it at background!! when the app is at background the songs plays for few seconds then it stops then i have to go to the app again to play the song!! its so annoying.. please fix it ....
Gaana,Snigdhatanu Roy Chowdhury,1,166,"whenever my mobile screen getting locked the app is stopping. never felt this before, but it's happening for last couple of months now. gaana was my primary app for songs for last 6 years, but am clueless about this new development. it made me to switch over to amazon music. please fix this as am missing gaana."
Gaana,Mohit Sharma,5,35,"music is my life.thnx ganana to show us a new way and collection of all my favorite. but only suggestion is to work on'' keyword prediction' if a person is unable to type exact word ,try to use prediction like google do apart from that i m a gaana plus user and miles satisfied with my decision. Gannna is a part of my day . love u #thnxteamganna."
Gaana,Ponraj M,2,7,"Very nice app, can listen songs in very high quality, especially i love bass.. but the only annoying thing from last few months, it takes 15-20mins to reboot my mobile:( its showing 'optimising the app 1 of 1...' for 20 mins.. i'd to reset refactory setting my phone and was re-installing each and every app to identify this stupid issue.. Team, can you fix this issue??"
Gaana,Gaurav Tomar,2,187,i am a paid member and my experience is jot at all pleasant. Some songs are not found on gaana. Some of the latest tracks were missing from gaana. The app takes a massive space on your device. I don't understand why the developers are not doing anything for that. Please look for alternative if you can. Gaana gave me a hard time.
Gaana,anubhav kamboj,1,17,"paid for this app and yet not received any services for its premium version gaana+ the app gives a premium version at a payment of rs. 399 as the annual subscription fees having paid that i am not able to use the services . kindly resolve the issue , i have sent the same issue thru email . i have the proof of payment . refund my money or provide the services . poor service thats all i can say for now"
Gaana,Gaurav Sharma,1,30,"French, Italian, Spanish song collection is poor, limited songs and repeated multiple times under various headings... no subtitles exist... even if some do, they are incomplete, WRONG: spelling and accents, synchronization is dead and off track... many artists doesn't seem to exist, images, cover photos missing... Can't find the equaliser..."
Gaana,Yasaswi Kadambari,3,56,"I initially chose Gaana over other streaming apps because of their huge Indian content, but the app is bad. The ""identity this song"" feature doesn't work at all. I lost more than half of my downloads suddenly without any reason, and when i try to download them again, the app keeps throwing errors. The play and pause icons during streaming are messed up and sometimes really confusing. Creating a playlist or a queue is a hassle. If future updates don't fix these, I have to uninstall."
Gaana,SAIO Indian,5,25,"it is the great app for listening music and now it has the version by which we can watch videos of the music it's really amazing, if you ask me for a personal experience then I will say it is really outstanding, provide me better facility. I am very helpful to gaana team."
Gaana,Sumit Saha,2,79,"Firstly I am a gaana plus subscriber, So, I'm reviewing this as i have faced some terrifying issues, 1. Utterly disgusted with ite downloads section, All the downloaded playlist songs and also the album songs are getting added to the songs section and i'm facing literally difficulty searching for the songs i've downloaded separately. Please fix this bug. Begging of you. You guys can follow the way saavan or jio music app manages the downloaded songs. 2. Please attach a sync now button."
Gaana,Pranav Vaidik Dhulipala,1,53,"1) They removed the ""cast"" option on the app.. really hate it. 2) Navigation of songs could be improved for the better. 3) The shuffle option does not shuffle the songs on the playlist properly. Fix it or you will easily lose a lot of customers."
Gaana,KRISHNA ROY,1,129,"recent version of gaana is worst than ever. Sound quality is poor, and preset volume is too less. When I am offline, I cannot see any song from my albums. I am a paid subscriber but it is a worst app.. Dont buy the app by single rupee payment. Problem of offline playing persists. Equalizer is great."
Gaana,Ravi Prakash,1,70,"After launch of world's most trending music service provider, Spotify, I must say Gaana doesn't even stands nearby. Whether it is compared with Live playing songs, more collection of songs. Gaana Devs please work on the area of Live Streaming and sound quality which I feel shabby over Spotify and YTMusic. Overall only good feature that makes me to use this app, Downloading feature which is only for Pro Users same as theirs."
Gaana,Alok Mehta,1,66,"after updating app ,it is using very much of data , background data consumption is more than 2 gb daily,video content is using very much data without opening it,it automatically plays in background and consumes a huge data , that's why i have uninstalled it please fix it .in my suggestion there shouls be another platform by gaana for streaming of video content."
Gaana,Krishnan Raman,2,84,I had originally subscribed Gaana+ at Rs.120/month. Now they have a special offer at Rs.299/year but the app won't allow me to purchase that saying i am already subscribed. It should allow loyal long term users the option to shift to a better price if available. Now I am paying 1440/yr instead of 299/yr that's on offer.
Gaana,INFINITY CLASHER,4,35,Certainely the best music app with various functions..I would like to say that everyone should use this app only for all types of music.U can find any type of music From Eng to Hindi and Bengali to Gujrati..Best music app for new upcoming generations..Gives a melodial tone and many much...The bad thing i can say that this app have download option while getting a plan for money..I think this would also be closed by This company..I will be very much happy if this problem should be solved..Best app.
Gaana,Kshitij Singh,1,41,I like the concept of bringing video songs on gaana but there should be control buttons to pause and play as in audio and add up new videos as it uploads on YouTube and also bring video quality options. I don't say bring these upgrades now but these upgrades are must. And also the Equalizer isn't supported on my OnePlus 6. I hope you guys will take my review to upbring Gaana. Thanks for the update and keep upgrading for us.
Gaana,Deeksha Prajapati,5,51,Hey developer.. Why I'm not getting the lyrics of the songs in the option panel.... It shows that lyrics are unavailable for the track... This problem is with every song.... In the beginning I got all the lyrics but now none of them is available Ohkk thanks for fixing the problem... Btw enjoying the app.... Probably th best gaana app for the leisure time
Gaana,Yash Keshri,1,20,"FRAUD. I tried to add card details to avail my coupon for 3 months subscription, but it's not adding my details for some silly reasons. I tried with three different cards but still not working and there is no other way of payment other than card. Seriously !?? when this app was created a decade ago? and not updated since. because it should have other mode of payments option."
Gaana,Prateek Guha,2,3583,"This app used to be good.. No idea if it's particularly on my phone or is happening to others too, but the app jumps 2-4 songs at once on it's own. Doesn't play continuously. Sometimes it just plays couple seconds and then suddenly jumps 2-3 tracks. Uninstalling this app for now. Also ""find this song"" doesn't work all the time. I'm using Nomia 6.1 Plus with Android Pie and Android one platform. Will reinstall only if I get a reply from the developer on any details or this issue gets fixed."
Gaana,Radia Maryam,4,1980,this app is amazing cause i can listen to songs yet i can use other apps..but one problem is i can't find song bangla songs that really frustrates me..if you guys that an option for uploading new songs just for my account..if you guys updated this option would really appreciate it..but its app is really cool i love love love it <3.
Gaana,Fedrick Lowden,1,45,"Finally I am uninstalling the Gaana application today and decided to switch to Jio Saavn application. Reason: Gaana mobile app's buffering speed is pathetic. It has a 5-6 secs of gap between 2 songs and sometimes buffers forever. (Now don't reply asking me to update my app as all my apps are on Auto Update) I am switching to Jio Saavn as it has the best buffering speed as if I am playing songs from my device. This isn't a bad review, this is just my feedback."
Gaana,Azad Singh,4,1544,"The app is great and has a collection of most of the songs. User interface is also good. The only thing which bothers me is the way i have to switch to offline mode. You guys should add a button to directly switch between online and offline mode, rather than going to settings page to do the same. I'll be happy to give 5 stars as soon as it is done."
Gaana,Jaydeep,1,11,"I paid for a full subscription but it feels like a very cheap freebie app. Gaana you have a whole lot to work on. Streaming is pathetic, keeps hanging, where as other apps like Google play music just works flawlessly. I feel it's waste of money to purchase subscription of Gaana."
Gaana,yash gupta,5,112,I am a gaana plus subscriber and I am very satisfied with its services. I can download unlimited songs plus no ads plus HD quality music and a wide range of Music files. So I am sure that you will be vey happy using the application whether its gaana plus or not... But I will advise you to avail the plus.
Gaana,Anmol Gupta,4,16,I like the app but hate how the player keeps hiding the buttons when a song is playing. The whole screen is just that blur album art image. It's super ugly to look at. That album art should NOT be stretched to cover the whole screen. And I don't want the buttons to keep hiding. Please give an option to turn that off.
Gaana,Krishan Jha,1,63,"your app is good but feedback team very third class, stupid people and you are not able to give you a single star, I purchased and paid for a subscription of rs. 299/- approximately before 1 month but still subscription not active or not refund me my amount. finally your work is very poor."
Gaana,Manish Verma,4,261,"The app is very amazing, can listen any song in very high quality anytime anywhere. but the only annoying thing from last Live EQUALIZER update, has happened that i cannot access my Snapdragon Audio + Equalizer, i can't control bass, can not change the pre-defined equalizers which was verrry goood than this Live Equalizer. i hope i get back access to my System Equalizer or Snapdragon Equalizer + very soon."
Gaana,gabz sangma,2,,"why does it gets stuck midway after playing songs. I downloaded many songs, and play them offline, now the problem is that it gets stuck midway. even if i press play and pause again it doesn't work. i have to forward a little bit to resume again for every song. kindly fix this problem. it was not this before the update."
Gaana,Anupam Joshi,1,23,"This App isn't for music lovers. It's a business which doesn't care much about features or their app. The app keeps running in background. They are constantly adding useless features like videos. 1. There is no option to add multiple songs to playlist at once. 2. No option to sort music by any parameters in playlist. 3. Playlist songs do not appear under ""Artists"", or ""Albums"" You literally can't do anything if you are creating your own playlists except for shuffle playing them."
Gaana,Mansimar Singh,5,48,"This app is my soulmate in sad times,soulmate in my good times and even in the times i want to remember the legendary Late Mohd.Rafi saab...!!! Gamma Gaana team...!!! what a gem you've produced guys... i would recommend all the users to upgrade your plan to gaana plus plan...!!! You won't be disappointed...!!!"
Gaana,Prosenjit Roy,1,2253,"Hello, why is it mandatory to agree to send my data to gaana? Isn't that a violation if privacy? I don't want you to feed me your selection and would like to choose my songs. And if it is mandatory then why is there a checkbox? Remove that for better rating. I'm uninstalling till this is done."
Gaana,Swida Dourado,5,5,"best music app other than all. frankly I have tried most and this is one of the best, great quality, more songs and less money, it even has student pack of more less money. A lot of thought has gone in this app. Great app I'm never uninstalling it"
Gaana,sunil mishra,2,,2 stars i love this app but all my songs plays just for 1 minute only then stops automatically. i have sent request to resolve but no reply.
Gaana,Abdullah Al Affan,5,,Excellent App to listen continuously music..! i just love it. Gaana has the huge collection of famous songs.
Gaana,Bhushan Sakade,1,22,"i have buy this app so i can listen songs without network & can download, now whenever i play downloaded song (shuffle mode) it always stop in the middle and i have to click pause button to play again, and it plays from the start... irritating didn't expected... fix it or if you can't, then don't sell this kind of service..."
Gaana,RED,5,266,"A music app that listens to you! After giving every music app a try for months—I finally settled with Gaana. Being an audiophile and classical music listener I can assure you it excels at sound quality, availability of varieties of local songs and easy syncing over other devices makes it better."
Gaana,Pianist Ash,4,2693,It's a great app. A few glitches here an there during downloading (queuing multiple downloads causes the app to lag) and searching (A suggestion would be keeping search results intact after we visit queue otherwise searching takes up time again). Rest it's amazing. Also it could be a little more smoother and fluid. Fix that and you'll deserve the 5 star rating.
Gaana,karan shah,5,238,"Very much use when feel boaring specially campus radio. Also some time sing a song of my favorite artist so its very easy to fine a song what i like the most very user friendly app. live radio is listing most from my side. thanks a lot to gaana team to make a such platform like this so now we can not store a song in our mobile. its a good choise to listen god bhajan. but i have one request basically i am from gujarat so can you please add Gujarati bhajan of master rana, ravi barvad. thanks."
Gaana,Shashank Reddy,1,1216,"I have subscribed to gaana+ in the browser in my PC and now when i try to login in through the same ID in gaana its not working.. It is just not logging in at all... the Google login button is not working, mobile number and gmail works but mobile created another account and you dont allow us tk merge accounts... and gmail just wont login... sucksss.. -5 for this issue .."
Gaana,Shreesh,2,55,Hi team I think gaana as a professional app. Please don't spoil it by endorsing some political parties. It's fine to give a message regarding election and voting ;but this is not acceptable. Request you to remove ads like these.
Gaana,Sumeet Jeswani,1,87,I had switched to night mode om automatic. but it seems this fucntion is not working properly. in daytime it is applying night mode and day mode in night many times.. Very poor settings. i choose to select repeat same song but it keeps playing random songs..Totally disappointed. better to download Sawan or Amazon Music. its much better compartively. Dont buy Gaana plus subsrciption. Go for Amazon Prime or Sawan.
Gaana,Mahesh D,1,15,Basic playback issue!! Am I only experiencing playback issues? The playlist just stops after playing one single song both on mobile and Chromecast! There is no battery saver enabled anf I already exempted gaana from battery optimisation. Facing this issue very much recently.. Seen some of the reviews mentioned about same issue.. hope ganna is working on it otherwise I need to switch the music app!!
Gaana,Abhilash Janardhanan,1,52,"Team Gaana, i have just unlocked the 3 months plan. trying to login with my mobile number, getting an error. Unable to login. also tried with email. it's asking for a password (which i don't have). tried with resetting it, didn't help either. can you please try fix the issue?"
Gaana,Adarsh Mehta,4,26,"The Worst Best App for Songs => Can download songs but doesnt download lyrics => Heats up the phone and consumes battery more than PubG does - Half of the time. Even when Internet is off! (its not just me facing this issue) => Small small UI issues like tough to seek the song duration in one shot, forgets the scrolled download point in the list after sometime, etc. Still, of course, out of all the other apps for songs, this is currently the best option. But it really pisses me off many times."
Gaana,Carl Crusader,3,,"Equalizer Issue The equalizer doesn't seem working. On clicking any of the option, either the volume shoots up or comes down. The fluctuation is too much. And also, the equalizer options doesn't add any effect to the audio. It was better earlier which allowed us to choose the system equalizer. Please add this functionality."
Gaana,Ayush Agarwal,5,4,The user interface is very very good. You will get all the new songs very early on it compared to other music apps. Sound quality is pretty good. The search results are also very relevant. Overall i would highly suggest you this app. Even you can take its subscription. Its very reasonable and you can get unlimited downloads.
Gaana,Techie Gossip,4,83,Gaana app is awesome super clearity. we would like have same app for amazon fire stick so we can play the some on tv whole family can listen it. We already have app but that very old and not updated. most good thing in gaana we like is lyrics in display awesome work by gaana team same we expecting same to be in amazon fire stick also. As i am long time subscriber
Gaana,Akash Thapa,1,38,"Liars!!! Before subscribe it has a button to download all songs, when I clicked, it asked me to buy a plan. I made a payment of Rs. 99 plan. When I visited to same page Download All BUTTON was DISAPPEARED. It didn't allow me to download songs in pc. For me it is useless."
Gaana,Evette Mark,5,22,I have tried installing and using many other apps of similar category but this is the best. it doesn't take A lot of time to load my fav random songs. it's an all time must app for the phone. i love gaan. thank you gaana team. you made a miracle for me. ❤
Gaana,sameer katyare,2,23,"I want to buy your Rs. 299/- year plus service but it's not allowing me to buy it with Google pay account, but in case of 30 day's free trail it's accepting directly from Google pay to continue use of plus service. Please solve the issues so that I can use your premium service."
Gaana,Karan Singh,2,7038,The lyrics of songs option in the app has disappeared.........I just downloaded this app because I can listen the song and can get the lyrics of the song as well both at the same time......but now when I play the song I don't see the lyrics please update me about this soon....... otherwise I have to delete this app....... because without lyrics it has became like other music apps......soo why do I go for this app
Gaana,abhishek pandey,1,178,"I am gaana plus user since almost a year, and from few days back its not showing me the lyrics for the songs which previously i used to get and have asked the same on help portal but no luck with that. please get it done or i will be bound to say worst app as i have got prime music and for future will use spotify."
Gaana,vivek indripala,1,46,hey i hate the new update ....dont be like youtube music..already youtube is there...gaana is the best app for music..dont ruin it with stupid update...we dont want to watch video of the song..ok just leave it like what it is...if u want add some new features think innovatively ok..i have been. using gaana from years.
Gaana,Shrinivas Narapareddy,5,63,"Great Music Pal to have you around. You got most of your songs and of good quality. Search, download to a play list and it is all there. More importantly it is avaie in multiple devices. I thoroughly love it."
Gaana,SA WebMedia,5,372,"awesome love it😘😘😍 I' like and love this application too much,as you like totally loved this application. Yesterday night, when i were listening @gaana that time I think about this, I want to request or suggest you(as you take), please add some features that is #Improving Google Assistant work (direct play),friendzone for @gaana listener (connectingSongs lover) and artist song collection( one artist with his all songs in a playlist or collection).  I think that was enough for now.  Thank You"
Gaana,Puneet Mishra,5,4,"Everything is just amazing as it supposed to be, but I really need that option after reinstall the Gaana app, I want all the songs as it is where they were before. please try to add it, it's really handy and if possible try to add data share, I need to download all the songs again in new device, very painful....😪"
Gaana,Anurag Mishra,1,19,"this app sucks. it starts playing songs automatically out of nowhere. The mobile is just kept on table, in between meeting the song will just start playing. Fix your bugs or else put this in terms and conditions, that anytime songa can play, without opening the app"
Gaana,Biju Issac,4,53,"Was facing problem in playing international songs, but the support team was good with their help. Earlier gave 1 🌟 increasing it to 4, as i want to listen to more similar songs, which Gaana does not do when I play similar songs, it just plays my fav or the once I most play. Similar songs should have more variety related to same genre or popularity or somthing like that."
Gaana,VAIBHAV JAY OJHA,1,65,What a pathetic update! I have been using this app for couple of years but now with the latest update I'm so pissed off that uninstallation is the only thing i need to do. App is Ridiculously bug ridden! Pauses and jumps on every song. What a rubbish update ur team has come up with. Damn
Gaana,Jitin Khanna,2,2,"This application misbehaves sometimes.. for sometimes it becomes very irritative to adjust,'like it stops unintendedly and start again even without giving a clue... it doesn't matter if you are through a corporate meeting.. and thats not the end... you will be able to stop it only by switching off your phone. thats very irritating and unprofessional.. thats very bad."
Gaana,Kithmini Kuruppuarachchi,1,23,30 second advertisements after every song is annoying. and also it's hard to use other apps in the background as the phone gets stuck. merely this app's issue as it doesn't occur when I uninstall this app. edit : 23-03-2019 advertisement length has gone down. but others above mentioned are still the same
Gaana,keshiraj deshmukh,2,73,previous version was good. songs do not get loaded as prior version. after update for every 1 minute song gets stopped. this is not related to network. i think app is not able to cop up with network. please check and release new update.
Gaana,Arindam Bose,1,33,I bought a 3 months coupon from paytm but when i tried to redeem it gaana asked to add credit/debit card which is not written at time of buying.Still I tried with my MasterCard Debit card but not supported bexause its needs specific banks card(in short private banks cards) so I lost my money because of you.Worst experience will never use gaana again.
Gaana,Kshitiz Kejriwal,3,12,"The overall experience is not so overwhelming.The app has glitches.Sometimes playing a song takes a lot of time to buffer, even when on a strong internet connection.Moreover, the issue which has started croopping up since the last update is that i get a notification from the android system that the app is consuming a lot of battery. Due to that I cannot seek songs from the notification bar itself.Plz fix these issues"
Gaana,Ruchik Bhatt,1,57,"pathetic. even after off the auto play songs, it will play automatically. there is no system like playist. yes its there but its never working. if you add 5 songs in a playist and repeat full songs still either it stop playing or it play songs which is not there in the playist. after complaining to Gaana they are not responsive and failed to resolve this issue."
Gaana,Manojit Kumar Dutta,4,66,A 5 star experience but gave 4 star because the android app could have been better in some aspects and the windows version doesn't get any better. Subscribed for Paid Subscription. Hoping to get better service. Already Love Gaana. Thanks.
Gaana,mansi mehta,5,65,My experience is really great with ganna but it would better if we can download songs without payment .... love ganna .... no more problems...... please try to fix it ( The problem ) For the problem there is a solution that maybe you can provide with us 7 days traial 😄 .... thank you
Gaana,A Google user,1,1,there is a problem in downloading. As we download a single song we can't listen or download other. The song hangs now and then. I have new smartphone but same problem. I have airtel sim. i don't know if the problem occurs with the sim card. But tower at my home come 100%. And gaana grabs lots of data in few minutes Plz get me a reply from ganna team. And the same lyrics problem showing Sometimes and not showing. And at any time song stops while having full data balance and full frequency tower.
Gaana,Shayne Joseph,1,37,No option to cancel subscription. It is not a professional business practice to not let the customer cancel the subscription. you have to jump through hoops to cancel a subscription. You should provide a simple way to do this. Will not recommend.
Gaana,A Google user,5,30,Not gonna lie I'm actually obsessed with this app. This app helps me to escape frm the reality and go to the world of my own. In every sad or happy moment of my life this app is always there. It turned out to be better than what i had imagined. Love this app🙂🙂
Gaana,Abhishek Kumar,5,55,its an amazing app .I listen song in my leasure time .Varieties of songs are available on this portal with its subtitle. But biggest problem i found in this app is about its search .It does not give approprite result on searching like i search motivational songs in bollywood it could not search a satisfactory result. And if i search same in utube then it gives desired result.So there needs to be little improvement in this regard .Rest of its functionaries are good .
Gaana,A Google user,1,1,why suddenly i can't play english songs? i had given 5 stars to this app before but now i am back for editing it. if english songs can not be played because they are not available in my region then why u ask to choose languages including english? i am using this app from about one and the half year now but now i am really disappointed with it.
Gaana,Vipul Dhomane,1,49,is there any way to cancel gaana plus subscription. this app was good but now it is the worst app. UI is complete waste no equaliser shortcut. and the new equaliser 😤😤😤 thank you for destroying the app. i will never renew it and whoever using this will tell him to uninstall and use saavn or Spotify
Gaana,rashmi kasav,5,62,"I felt this app really useful .First of all its audio so we can listen to our song and do other work also and we can share it anywhere bluetooth, whats app etc.. very useful and this app has to much popular in India. Just loved it😊😊😊"
Gaana,Anandu S Pillai,4,111,Clean UI Suggestions. 1.Remove quick settings in home tab/ shift to left swipe navigation drawer. 2.Banner in radio for one tap can be replaced with the four options that comes after thr tap. 3. My music can be cleaned up by removing party hub.(Already present in navigation drawer.) 4.Made for you mixes in the my music tab can be made collapsible same as the browse by categories.
Gaana,Rahul Agarwal,1,17,This is for not working on the feedback mail sent a month back and keeping some biggest hit songs missing on the app. I was thinking of Plus subscription and thanks to god I first sent u a feedback mail before wasting my money. The song does not load smoothly even on a high speed network and this app is getting worst day by day. Some apps deserve to be used free.
Gaana,ashvini sharma,2,30,"Useless app, earlier i thought there is network problem. later found its problem with App itself. manytime didn't play music just wait and wait to get stream.. also many bugs like playist doesn't sync while changing device.... newly added songs doesn't shows up while edit playlist.. like so many bugs.. GOD knows. how this exist in market.. i even don't want to use depsite for free and people are paying for this app.. lol.. weird..."
Gaana,Sanat Mishra,1,16,Just by providing music through a app if you think your job is finished then I am sorry I need some minus star to give you people. Your app is such a worst app that no body is their in the support to listen and from last 10 days I am continuously trying to login and update my account and I am unable to do that. Being in the competitive app market if your service will be like this then your future is clearly visible.
Gaana,Ajith K Thomas,2,39,"Facing some difficulties on playing in bluetooth, when reconnecting with the same bluetooth device, music will playing from first instead of resuming where it's stops or disconnected.. Very difficult in playing music while travelling or connecting with car bluetooth audio.. Always playing from first while reconnected with the bt device.. Its very annoying and needs to skip up to the last played song.. Please try to fix this issue.. Other music players are working fine.."
Gaana,SRIHARIRAO M,1,5,"What happened to app. the app unable to save my settings. even i have changed the song stream quality to high, after 1or 2 songs its back to low. also the equalizer working so miserable. The songs are not so crisp as other apps."
Gaana,Rajat Kandpal,4,110,The equilizer is not optimized and everytime i switch to settings it automatically change the done profile to a unique loud sound profile. I specifically downloaded the older version 8.0.4 for this exact reason. Give us an option to manually apply the sound profile.
Gaana,Pramod Deshpande,5,44,"Hats off Gaana ! U are one of the best music Apps. Far better than other music Apps. i have used viz; Wynk, Hungama. Pls. include more 'Dasara Padagalu', devotional songs by artists sheshagiridas raichur, ananth kulkarni, puttur narasimh naik, etc. All the best once again !"
Gaana,AkasH MandaL,1,21,"it was good earlier but after some updates i Don't know whats wrong with this app apart from this it has a serious problem of search, you can't simply sreach the song of your taste recently I've searched a song i didn't found this but when i m sreached the artist name and saw all his songs that song was there with the same name that I had Sreached it is so pathetic i don't know why i opted for the paid version. it is even worst than Hungama...and also it lacks on variety of songs."
Gaana,Siddharth Chandrasekaran,1,3,"There is a bug in your the recent version of Gaana. The app plays some song randomly after a call. This song keeps playing even when there is no background app. Took some time to figure out which app was causing this issue. To fix it, I have to open gaana and then kill. Huge annoyance."
Gaana,Anurag Das,3,77,"Well, nothing too bad about the app considering its free. But i feel it would have been better to allow creating offline favourite list than forcing user to login. Also strangely in android pie, the player control on lock screen is no more appearing - thats the most irritating part as of now."
Gaana,thamjid noufal,4,13,"latest version of this app doesnt works in my phone. none of the online services are working including radio, music search, recommended song etc. only i am able to play the songs i downloaded already. now i re installed the app and those downloaded songs also get deleted. what should i do? will you compensate for my gaana plus subscription?"
Gaana,A Google user,4,640,it has been good experience with this app.... i have been using this app for 2-3 months.... this is an awesome music player app..... but sometimes i don't find some songs lyrics.... this is little problem.... i want only thing that each songs lyrics should be given..... well i am loving this app😘
Gaana,Moin Syed,1,31,"Unsubscribed from premium account and uninstalled the app  Problems: 1. Login has massive issues, I use Google login and for every update I need to ask the gaana support team to fix login issue, Till then i need to bear ads in app even though I am a premium member 2. More popups to download songs even for premium members 3. Smart downloads forces and auto downloads few songs, keeps coming back even after i delete them"
Gaana,Tushar Tripathi,3,1,"While using this app with Bluetooth Speaker, whenever a song changes music seems to stop playing but in the background song is running. Initially i thought there is a problem with my device but it only happens while using Gaana. This problem occurs after every 2-3 songs. Help needed!!!!!!"
Gaana,shaktisourav mishra,2,,it should improve sound bass and clarity like jio saavan ..jio saavan has improved a lot recently in equalizer .want to see gaana in top.jio saavan is one only coz of its sound bass and equalizer
Gaana,Deep Styles,5,72,i m literally in love with this app. my best way to pass time or change my sad or worse mood is by listening the songs and singing the lyrics..best part is u can see so many songs in the playlist of ur fav singers..hence it is the best app..
Gaana,Ashika Shetty H,1,23,"Inconvenient app . Waste of money The songs just stop playing in between both during online usage and offline usage. This inconvenience weighs more for me, since I'm a gaana plus user. Also in the past the app would just log me out for no reason . Not renewing my subscription for this one."
Gaana,Pratik Kumar,5,1,"It's a nice application for music lovers, Recently have found a major bug and it is irritating, I have seen that sometimes if you miss an incoming call (given : gaana is running in background and player is paused ) Gaana automatically starts playing random songs, this happens to me in office meeting. Please take a look"
Gaana,A Google user,5,26,"I hope they don't charge us for downloads.But I still love this app. I'm a music lover, this has been my best friend for the past 2 years.Still there are few problems, but I hope they deal with it soon! Good app, must download this app. 😘"
Gaana,A Google user,5,16,"Best high quality ultra bass song and unique mixing remix and unique dj song with no add's, found here.""Gaana"" is my favorite music app.It's some unique features are most attractive.""Gaana"" also provide you latest new release original ultra sound national and international track's that's why everyone (who has use ""Gaana"") can stay updated.😍😍"
Gaana,Amit Mistry,1,7,"Most pathetic App! Don't ever try to get it!! If you have an unpaid account, it's useless and worthless, you'll not get auto shuffle option working properly. It only picks last 3-4 songs and repeats."
Gaana,Brij Teli,2,42,"App auto crashes while playing, even when no autokill app installed in phone... Have heard same complaints for last 6 months from many of my friends... Needs Good User friendly updates, including playlists like-new Hindi Road trip, which are a major miss... please do needful..."
Gaana,Nikhil Khare,4,20,"Support for Chromecast is not good its not running on auto playback, each time I connect and play a song then I lock my phone the app is getting exited on its own and I have to go and play the next song by myself. Other than this everything is good."
Gaana,Đ¡Řã ŔøÝ,5,31,This app is the best song app I had ever seen... I am just loving this.... I hadn't downloaded this app for a while but when I saw a very close and special person of mine using this I do started using this app... thnk u....

Gaana,BbeKrishnendu Dhara,5,24,"The best music app ever . If you can't understand a word, it gives you the lyrics of the song . It has almost all song of all languages and you can also search for a song . Love this music app ver very much"
Gaana,Surya Prakash,1,7,This app is a poorly written piece of junk. It single-handedly caused the 'Android is starting Optimising Apps x of x' error in my phone. There are way better and safer alternatives available. Look elsewhere for your music.
Gaana,Sohel,5,5,I subscribed this app today. So far it's a nice app but only issue I am facing is I am not being able to control my music by bluetooth controller (neither my Beats earphone or car bluetooth). Please fix this issue.
Gaana,uday yadav,1,1,it's a really so horrible 2 use this app i mean seriously it still charges monthly for just listening and downloading the audio songs there is lot of websites available where songs can be downloaded free . so why as being a student i cant spent monthly charges just 2 use this app. Atleast u can provide some schemes for students like Apple music or why not free of cost it would be a pleasure for us. thanks
Gaana,amit hombal,1,1,"When iam saying radio's available in radio section, only the first song will be played, it won't go next, it ll get stopped there itself. Radio is live streaming if iam right!! Then why the hell it's getting stopped always. This problem is happening with me every time. Fix it asap."
Gaana,A Google user,5,79,Very good so far. Great collection. Radio music quality can be better. Need more curated playlists to show up on my home page. Gaana logo looks dated both on the home screen and the notification area. Please change it.
Gaana,Chandra Prabha Ghosh,1,65,it's consuming too much data after the video feature update. Today when I played 2 songs it consumed 238 mb even after the fact that I've turned off video playback from settings. Also it's draining battery. so don't install this use Jio Saavn instead
Gaana,Shayan D,2,9,"I am a premium subscriber but after using this app for 6 months I am writing this...this app is lacking many songs as many bengali, punjabi and hindi songs are not available ...gaana app has some problem with the collection problem whereas other app provides almost all songs i search for..so i hope it is nit worth it purchasing the premium subscription whereas i am getting all same features from other apps too with better collections"
Gaana,Prashant Suskar,2,12,The only reason to give 2 star is new equilizer modes. These modes sucks. I've started listening with other app becauseof this. This is possibly the worst update ever. Please revert this update or add previous custom equilizer.
Gaana,A Google user,1,63,"Give option to disable Equalizer, Gaana's inbuilt Equalizer stops processing of my phone's equalizer (viper4android) ..so instead of kepping it on give option to toggle it on/off... unable to listen a single song due to this...give update to toggle ASAP. Thanks"
Gaana,Rohan Tembhare,4,30,"Great song app, really loved it. Just 1 single improvement to be made is that when the song is paused and after sometime we are about to play it fron where it was paused the app just closes itself and we have to restart the song which we were playing which is quite annoying."
Gaana,Sundeep Yaduvanshi,1,15,"They are fraud. Never ever provide them your card details. They will charge you even after revoking the instructions related to the renewal. They don't even care to call you or reply to your mails. Further, they will breach your financial privacy by deducting money on their own wish. They cancelled my 3 months Promo period 1 month prior to it's completion. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS TO CANCEL OR REMOVE YOUR CARD DETAILS FROM THE APP."
Gaana,Dhruv Agrawal,1,17,Wrost app. just got the gaana+ free code and when i apply it on gaana app. they force me to purachse 1 yrs pack first then only my 3 month free ganna+ will start such a wrong way for earing money. I never used ganna because I already have Jio music but because kf this free code I decided to use it but actually after applying code I found it's a trap for us we should give detail of card first & then only free code will work means after 3 month they will deduct money from my code without notice.
Gaana,Sayali Shinde,5,70,"l can't describe it until i use this app ,it is installing from almost 20minutes even download is completed i m excited to use this application please install quickly i think it may be very nice application for listening songs too nice it has to be best application because there are many expectation have peopla from this application i think it would be too much good"

Gaana,alen roy,4,79,"After the whole ui change update ive been in love with gaana but in recent days a lot of problems have been occuring like,the song stops playing in the middle and some songs not playing at all.Another this is gaana's song recomendation is very poor compared to other streaming apps like i'll be palying a malayalam song,after the song finishes playing a punjabi song in a whole new genere will start palying."
Gaana,A Google user,4,14,"This app is the love of my life. I'm in love with this app. But I'm highly disappointed when i founded out that 'Gaana' doesn't come with the sleep timer feature. I'm longing to see that change in the upcoming versions. looking forward for having a better experience and customization. Regards,"
Gaana,Shivam,5,55,The app has improved a lot recently in terms of UI. It's really appreciated. Please pay a bit of attention to the playing screen as well. The album art looks pixelated and blurry.
Gaana,RA styles,5,27,This is very nice and good mumusic app. This is very lovely app. This is so nice. Really This is world's best music app in the world. please please download This app and phir khud hi dekh lo. ye bahoot kam data par bhi chal jata hai. Really so excellent app.
Gaana,Amitash Degan,5,17,"Great app for listening to music. the download feature is amazing. only prob is that it asks for downloading 2 be done again after a couple of days. Kindly make a feature for permanent downloads. otherwise the app is very great & phenomenal. it has all the collections of Indian Classical, Bollywood, Latest English songs etc. only pl try 2 make the download feature permanent. The notifications like the curated lists r gr8. Keep updating and i will keep listening. Bus Bajna Chaiye Gaana. Thnx TOI"
Gaana,microTALES,1,10,"gaana for windows pc is the worst experience anyone can have. once the app is closed after finishing the downloads then when you open again there's nothing under the downloads tab, youll have to search again for the albums and then after clicking on download button itll show downloaded. even the downloaded songs dosent play while the rest of the songs is downloading. you pay for their pathetic service 😡"
Gaana,Bhakti Kadam,1,2,have paid for annual subscription...since last month it has been observed that song suddenly stops after 2 to 3 minutes n again u have to press play button it is very annoying... gaana was my life ..used listen almost for 10 to 12 hrs but due to this interruptions...doesn't feel like to open the app...pls resolve the issue or return my annual subscription amount...this kind of service will definitely loose your prime customers...😥

I wanted to buy plan of 299 but while payment its 399. tried to reach help but no response. other than that, truly happy with app."
Gaana,nishant panda,1,1,Never ever take paid services for gaana+ your information gets used by someone else and the supporting team is also useless. Use it for free if you want but the app is useless. You pay for it and many others will use it ...never give your details to gaana ..i am already regretting it.
Gaana,Chaku,3,1,"On other devices playlists do not appear. Also, playlists don't get an update, if I add a song. Please fix this. I mean account doesn't get synchronized. Also a song stops for 1 or 2 seconds, or get skipped for that time like a glitch."

Gaana,Madhusudhan Reddy,4,85,sound superb bgms also available lyrics available if you are wearing headphones listening to songs you are going to haven for sure. all languages are available...the only drawback is for downloading it is asking money.... please some people's like songs and may not to pay money.....pls do concern om them
Gaana,Chakravarthy Garlapati,1,9,"i took one year subscription unfortunately the app is so buggy that when we add the songs the playlist does not show all the songs in the list and never plays qhen using that lost, but when we edit them the songs will be displayed. I am seriously thinking to move bavk to spotify as these people never care about customers. I can upload the images of the same if it allows me to add."
Gaana,Aman Chabukswar,1,21,"I'm a Gaana+ User. and I saw there is no new electronics music songs which JioSaavn is provding on same day of released but Gaana is pathetic in that case. I requested Earlier about that but there is No changes just added few old songs. The Great music producers like KSHMR, Armin van buuren, Hardwell. this people are getting relasing big hits but you people are out dated in that case to update in your system. Please have a some Shame about this outdated mind musics Indian Musics are not everythin"
Gaana,Sheikh Nawab Arzoo,1,,the battery consumption in offline mode (download music ) is tooo high . no other apps consumes that much . for 1hrs music playback in offline mode consumes 20% of my battery life on OnePlus 5. where jiosawan 3% in 1hrs offline mode Spotify 4 % in 1hrs 20 min offline mode but ganna 20% in 1hrs offline mode its ruins my music playback experience . something wrong with this app . please fix it . if you need logs i can provide that . till then i will use other music services.
Gaana,Krishnachaitanya Suram,2,279,Please remove the double back button in the App exit. You're making it very inconvenient and irritating for users to exit the App. What's the reason behind this?
Gaana,A Google user,5,84,Best musical app. All your music is here. Nice collection of songs. Give updates about trending songs. Have collection of songs on mood. I personally am a happy user (as a music lover).
Gaana,Riya Kothari,2,22,something has happened. Not able to listen to engkish songs. only the covers are available now. No original music. It says the content is not available in your region. Please do something about it. Music means so much to me.
Gaana,Rishav Pandey,1,22,"There's a issue, I'm always facing. while playing a song, if someone's call, song should've been paused so that, it could notify about incoming call but instead of it, songs continues to play even during incoming call."
Gaana,Anisha yadav,5,,it's the best music app amongst all bcoz firstly i tired the hungama music in which all of the songs are not available but gaana app is just amazing n bestest music app i can say
Amazon Music,Gene Giblin,5,1472,"Beats listening to the radio!! Just pick the type of music you want to listen to and let it play. No ads, no interuptions, just pure music. If a song comes on that you don't like or doesn't fit your mood, just give it a thumbs down or skip to the next song and keep on "" listening to the music"" as the ""Doobie Brothers"" would say!! Enjoy!!!"
Amazon Music,Blakc Guytuff,1,1231,"too many issues. music I've downloaded with prime will stop and tell me to make sure my time is accurate, music I've purchased wont show up and still tells me I need unlimited, and music I've downloaded from other sources wont upload to Amazon Music. the app has many issues that I've reported 2 years ago, but still hasn't fixed. I'd recommend using another app. Amazon support gives no solution for the time issue. only to uninstall the songs and redownload them, which is a hassle."
Amazon Music,Orlando Villalobos Finigan,3,3,"today's update has totally messed up my music, cant listen to my music now, and I pay for the unlimited. what's going on. why change things that worked perfectly fine to begin with(as of 31 June) no word back from development team who replied to this. and on phone said this is a know issue and its MY fault for having an android S9+ and it works on most other android....... app working a bit better bit still keeps crashing and taking ages to download"
Amazon Music,000,1,227,"Do not use this app!!!!!!!!!!! resulted in all my playlists being destroyed, any purchased music is only for a very limited period i havent been comiling digital music for ling and i have already had about half my music taken away from me with no warning! i never would have purchased music from them had i have been made aware of this compleat and utter waiste of my time and money and tbe customer service is utterly apaling!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Amazon Music,Jennifer Haynes,1,2,Downloaded the newest update and now I cant play half of my music. This isnt music coming from my Prime subscription. This is music I've bought and paid for. I can play 10 to 15 seconds of some songs and then it skips. Then other songs it will play the whole way through. I have never experienced this issue in the past so this is definitely some sort of problem with the latest update. I'll update my rating when I can listen to my music on my phone again.
Amazon Music,Antonio Gonzalez,4,4,"I have had nothing but good experiences with this app. But for some reason, since this new update (May, 29), there has been little problems. For example, its not letting me shuffle my music, even when I shuffle it. it plays the same 3 songs. Also, when I want to listen to a certain songs, and I click on it, it gives me an entirely different song. I'm not mad about it, it's just really annoying"
Amazon Music,Shane Schaffer,1,126,"fix this app it sucks! why is this app so inferior to iTunes!?!?!? I can select an entire album to download, but I cant delete an entire album. someone needs their head examined! most likely going to discontinue this service being that this app sucks and crashes all the time. Also your streaming servers suck. I can watch a video on YouTube with perfect streaming, but Amazon music hangs up and pauses constantly! I dont recommend this service to anyone including my enemies."
Amazon Music,Mehul Kumar,5,140,"best music streaming app i could find till now, love the collection of songs and audio quality and even the custom made playlists they're all amazing. i just hope you guys change the user interface a little bit because it looks a little outdated, please try to keep up with the competition in terms of ui make it a little more material design"
Amazon Music,Ryan Schofield,1,112,"Amazon music deleted all song in all my playlists, why I don't know!!!!! Was enjoying this service and app until I woke up this morning and found all songs had been removed from all my playlists. I had one playlist with over 300 songs in and now I have to start all over again!!!! Not impressed!!!! 😤😤😤 A week after- update- Amazon still have not replied. I want a replie Amazon. 😤😤😤"
Amazon Music,Peter Archer,1,701,"I'm sick of this app. Yes it works good with the Echo family and streaming to my phone is fine but download music and play it offline and it's a whole different experience. The music randomly stutters, crackles and frequently takes up to a minute to transition between songs! This is not a new thing as many users online testify to so I don't understand why it is so difficult for the developers to fix. Stop focusing on the new stuff and fix the basics first. Customer service no help at all."
Amazon Music,Shawn Awesome,5,2,"I like the radio playlists. wish they would bring back playlist download so I can use it where theres no data signal. Good app though. thank goodness there are no advertising interruptions. Hope I didn't just jinx that !! only disappointing thing is the extra charge for unlimited.... What's the deal? I'm already paying""Prime"" fees. A reputation for greed pays no dividends."
Amazon Music,Giles Wilson,1,83,Latest update hasn't solved any of it's issues it's just a mess list below. 1. If you turn your phone and use it in landscape mode most of the buttons are squashed or missing 2. It stops playing every 5 mins maybe less. 3. The album art looks very low Res. 4. There's still now way of adjust the mid low and highs. 5. Albums that are purchase and downloaded become unavailable quite regularly. 6. There's no way of turning off the awful looking scrolling lyrics. Back to using Google music.
Amazon Music,Zachariah Tiedemann,2,27,"The app glitches quite frequently. I have a band-aid fix for my problem but no permanent solution. It was given to me by their support help. I don't care for being negative, but this has been an ongoing problem. The app doesn't recognize every song that I download to my offline file AND every time I shut my phone down I have to log out and back in to get my songs back. I can't make playlists for my offline music anymore either."
Amazon Music,A Google user,2,30,"all it is, is a collection of the less salable crapier selection. It's obvious when it's all live versions an you gotta pay for the good cut. And you take back free songs when the artist gets popular again. THAT still burns me. It's one thing for an artist to return to the pay for list, but the Behemoth NEEDS to TAKE back my song? I have vested time in this song list or I'd not return again. I had a HUGE pirated song list on my stolen phone. Looks like the way to go again."
Amazon Music,Kristen Sikora,2,25,"I have had to uninstall and reinstall this app over and over again. I pay for Prime Music and I expect to be able to listen to songs that I have heard before and even given thumbs up to. Every couple of weeks a message pops up saying that Amazon can't play this song right now, even though I'd heard it plenty of times before. You are then told to contact Amazon to tell them about the problem but don't waste your time because the mailbox is always full. I think I'll cancel and go back to Pandora."
Amazon Music,Mansi Dugar,2,3,this app has so many issues. I make a playlist it stops after playing the first song. I add songs to a playlist and it still doesn't show in the playlist. I have tried deleting the playlist and making it again but nothing works. sometimes it doesn't detect my voice when playing a song. please fix these issues
Amazon Music,A Google user,4,208,I've given this app multiple chances including prime subscriptions and it still doesn't seem to pan out to my liking. I'd again rather just purchase my songs thru this app to sync to another music app that complement a simple music genre playlist of my choice. This app is also suppose to automatically download my new purchases when set to do so thru the settings menu and it doesn't. I have to manually download after each purchase everytime...very annoying.
Amazon Music,Amit Kay,1,24,"[ Edit ] App started crashing frequently 😫 it was a decent and useful app, though best part was large music collection and not really some great user experience (I've seen better). for sometime, possibly an update which i didn't notice, its acting weird 1. launches itself, when I indirectly stop by removing earphones. 2. automatically toggles volume 3. hangs intermittently 4. sometimes, automatically goes in loop of pause and play but for the nice music collection, i want to uninstall this 😫"
Amazon Music,Kevin Kitchen,1,34,"Don't waste your time making a playlist. Amazon will block the whole list if one song gets removed from their choices. Don't waste your time downloading any songs either. Amazon just deleted 317 songs from my phone because they no longer have one of them. Other than that, it works great. Definitely not worth paying for."
Amazon Music,CM JORDAN,2,7,"One star app, but I gave 2* cuz no ads. When the app updates, all my downloaded playlists disappear. The app takes forever to start up, even when you don't want to stream music. There's also a limited choice of free music. The ""unlimited"" is available for a fee, but not really worth it. I can't find an app to play Amazon music files and music from other sources won't play on the app either. Its not a horrible app, but unless you like using up your data to repeatedly download the same music..."
Amazon Music,Miranda Seymour,1,1,"I love this for music, great selection of songs, easy to use but the family plan is junk!!!! It kicks off the extra family members at least once a week, then you have to go through adding them again and who knows how long it will actually last. The downloaded songs still buffer, the app pauses songs, sometimes just randomly shutting the app down. It definitely needs some improvements for the price."
Amazon Music,T. B.,2,16,"Amazon keeps wanting more $. Already paying for prime, and now they want a monthly fee to listen, not giving an option to simply buy. Big problem with music that I've purchased literally disappearing from my library. Recently, 2 songs purchased, removed, and they said it was due to the musician's contract ending with Amazon. I replied that I bought the songs and should own them, regardless of what's going on with their contract. I lost the songs permanently and got a $1.98 credit."
Amazon Music,Steve M,1,20,"unusable now. continues to skip, stop, start, cutting out. doesn't matter if I'm on a strong wi/fi signal or using my data. also doesn't matter if song has been downloaded or even if the song is one that I own and loaded on my phone without going through Amazon."
Amazon Music,Ed Easley,1,14,"This app is a heinous travesty. Search for a song to play, plays that song, app creates a playlist of every song in the search. Best of luck getting it to work with hands free connections. Create a playlist on the desktop app? These changes to the playlist rarely transfer to the mobile app. If you are trying to play songs downloaded to your device because you are saving data or on the edge of a connection, it still assumes you want to play songs you don't have downloaded, useless for road trips."
Amazon Music,Benjamin Woodland,5,14,"it's a good music platform with no adds (that's five stars right there) I can use on all devices (I don't buy my music on the player that doesn't work on Android - if they get my drift) with only a few issues on my 5 year old phone. My only major objection is the unlimited policy - I already pay for Prime and I don't use the app enough to pay more for what I can get on YouTube, so I guess it doesn't matter. All in all, great app with Prime."
Amazon Music,Barbara Waluś,2,9,"Good at first, really annoying later on. 1. You have to have the app open to play music, which means it consumes a lot of battery. This is not the case with other music apps which can run in the background such Google Play Music. 2. My playlist keeps getting cleared, despite all the music on it being downloaded for offline use. It's happened twice in 4 weeks. 3. What is it about offline music 'expiring'?! If you don't have wifi and can't do a 'refresh', you can't listen to music. Great."
Amazon Music,Baruch Raphael,1,4,"The app looses my purchased songs all the time. Though I never sign out, I have to sign in every time I use this app. Worst app ever. No comparison with the reliable Audible app. Won't purchase songs from Amazon any more. It's ridiculous, that I have to download my own songs every time, although I never sign out of the app. It's the same on all my mobile devices."
Amazon Music,Andrew Doe,1,5,"Easily the worst music app available. Unfortunately, i paid for content and i can only use it in the app. You're basically held hostage by Amazon. you don't really own what you purchase, and the app works 20-30% of the time. The app crashes and freezes constantly, then switches to your entire library instead of staying in your playlist. This is basically a beta, of a first version that shouldn't have been released."
Amazon Music,Conor O'Neill,2,12,"I have only one problem with this app but for me it's a big one. I use it to stream music when in driving, by Bluetoothing it to my stereo. But the app times out after 30 mins, saying ""you've been away for a while, do you want to keep listening? "". As i can't use my phone when driving all I'm left with is silence. No option in app to turn this off. Incredibly frustrating."
Amazon Music,Caleb Ruppert,1,2,"Sure, it plays music. The one star is compared to other music services, there are just way better out there. Amazon's is glitch ridden, even if you're taking up space on your device to download the album or playlist. It is ridiculously non-navigable, when you try to get to one screen it takes you to random different ones. For instance, if you want to go to the album page, it'll take you to the artist page, or to a ""recents"" page."
Amazon Music,Vicki James,3,7,"It has more updated music than Google Play Music, but unless you pay the extra 8 bucks a month it stops play after a while! I have unlimited data so I can play music thru the night, I don't need an app to monitor me! Google will play thru the night - which is when I play music. But I'm already playing 13 bucks a month for Amazon Prime! Music should be included in that! It's just frustrating."
Amazon Music,Craig Doughty,1,8,"Was stable and extensive throughout 2018. However, recently the app has been prone to crashing, it lags, and much of my downloaded and purchased music has disappeared. It is also annoying to find that albums that were available on sign-up are not available a few weeks later. The worst is when you want to listen to an album but find that one track is not available/frozen out of the stream list. Ugh."
Amazon Music,J Allison,4,,"Enjoy the app but get really annoyed when it shuts down on my wi-fi tablet. I no longer have internet at home and have to go on an 16 mile round trip to the nearest free wi-fi to restore my access to my music. I understand why it was done that way, but paying folk really shouldn't have to deal with this. It would be nice if all disconnected apps/devices wait to ""hide"" the music until account expiration date and not before."
Amazon Music,Michael Baker,3,2,"The variety of music is wide, however if you pick a station and stay with it, the variety lessens within the genre. I have found many songs get played over and over to the point I'm skipping more often than listening. I prefer not to dislike so many songs but there is no option to put a song on snooze for a month or so so I can hear other songs in that genre. Otherwise, an easy explorable music app with many choices."
Amazon Music,Dan Summers,2,7,what is going on with my Amazon music app? I've had this app for just over a month now and had no problems until now. I will listen to a couple songs then the app pauses my music and I have to open my phone to start it again. what's going on? I never have these issues with Google music and think I might cancel my Amazon music. I tried rebooting my app and uninstalled it and restarted my phone and I still get this issue. Any fix soon?
Amazon Music,Cameron McIntosh,1,9,"A shockingly poor app for such a massive company to put their brand on. You must use it if you want access to the music your Prime subscription gives you, but it's really frustrating, slow, and unreliable. I held off on one starring this for years after its release thinking surely they'd work out the kinks in updates over time. But at this point, there are really no excuses."
Amazon Music,Peter Church,3,2,"bugs that are hard to pinpoint. Try adding music to a playlist I have already created. Never adds first time. I find I have to find the song again to add again. when I do, I often find that it doesn't always recognise that my playlist exists until after a number of attempts of trying to find the song in different places. Otherwise, the app is great for getting access to music I haven't tried before without the extra cost."
Amazon Music,Avik Ghosh,3,1,"The app is ok, but it keeps crashing on my ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2. Also there are a lot of Indian Bollywood songs, that I can't find on the app. You definitely need to fix these issues, specially when it's a paid app. Also the music isn't very smooth. It keeps halting for a fraction of a second. I don't expect this when I have downloaded all the songs on my playlist. I looks like its looking for internet even when it doesn't need to look for it."
Amazon Music,Daniel Sahn,4,1,"Great quality while streaming and also listening to downloaded music offline. I understand Amazon plans to discontinue this feature at some point, but for the price, you can't go wrong. The only downswing - no equalizer settings. This can easily be managed by a separate app, however, it would be a lot more convenient if it were a feature included. Still a great music app."
Amazon Music,Brian,1,3,"This app has a number of persistent problems that have ultimately led me to cancel my Amazon Music subscription and switch to a different service. Among the most frustrating of these issues: (1) songs added to a playlist often will not appear in that playlist, though re-attempting to add the song results in a message stating the song is already in the specified playlist, (2) using the ""play next"" option results in the current song replaying from the beginning, (3) if a song is downloaded to my device, other not-downloaded songs from the same playlist become ""unavailable on [my] device"", (4) the app freezes or closes unexpectedly on a regular basis, (5) the app recently cleared all of the downloaded music on my device. I have used this app for > 2 years and have been patiently optimistic that an update would resolve any one of these issues, but this has not been the case. I would strongly recommend considering a music provider with a more functional app."
Amazon Music,Blake Tennyson,1,1,"editing my review to 1 star, it's great with the Amazon Alexa devices but if you're trying to listen to music in the car from your phone (90% of the time I actually use this app) then it constantly cuts out even if I've got full bars. one of my friends is having the same issues! please fix this issue! I dont like my music to sound like I'm carrying around a CD player with a scratched up CD!"
Amazon Music,Kenneth Appleby,3,2,Was loving this app until i was offered 90 days free to upgrade to the family plan. I thought sure I'll do that. Then BOOM!!! I got charged. When trying to fix the situation the idiots completely cancelled my subscription. Now I'm told if I subscribe again I'll be refunded money. Why would i resubscribe to something that I'll be charged for just to be refunded? Y'all gonna refund be 3 months in a row? I was offered 90 days free!! Your tech support is a joke! Barely even spoke English!
Amazon Music,Heather- DivineChaos,1,5,Love it but u know u WAAAAAY overcharging me. 😞 Why the hell I never got my 3 months at 4.99? And why as a student & Amazon prime member am I paying 10.99 a/mo? I've called and you guys still don't fix the issue or adjust the billing... Seriously cancelling this service. Ain't like these songs aren't available elsewhere... Update: Since Amazon cant get their ish together I've moved to youtube for less per month... amazon get ur ish together. Tell jeff I said no more ducketts from me. 😱
Amazon Music,Johnjoe Nugent,2,,"Overall the app gets the job done but I'm not a big fan of the interface, I think it could be simplified for easy access and navigating. It's cluttered and just not intuitive. - When browsing artists albums, it's quicker to use android's drop down menu to go to the next song. - Often when I start the app it spends too much time thinking. Google music did a better job in this regard and has a better selection from what I can see."
Amazon Music,Justin Corwith,1,3,"This app is the worst! Not sure when it started but now it's decided to start pausing between tracks, at times before the track even finishes. I have been using this app for years and just over the last year this started. Also, it takes half a day to load if not on Wi-Fi, even on my Offline list and if I try to play a station it glitches if it comes across a track in my library and won't let me send the Report! DEAR AMAZON WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO WITH THIS? A Loyal Audiophile!"
Amazon Music,Richard J,1,5,"don't expect you can listen music if you don't pay. everything will be grayed and non playable if you're not subscribe and pay them. even as an Amazon Prime member (paying $13/month), we still have to pay $9 for unlimited music. changed to other app/service which we don't have to pay, but we still can listen to musics. I even unsubscribed from the Prime member."
Amazon Music,Tom's Inspirations,2,2,"I've been using it for many years. It is expensive per month, so I get it paid annually and it's a little cheaper. It has a limited version for free with Amazon Prime, but the system learns your likes and removes songs that you want. With both versions, after you finally get a song, they make it unavailable shortly after you have added it to your music. The pay version has a lot of songs. I have yet to not find a song. Almost ready to dump the whole thing!"
Amazon Music,Anish George,1,5,"I am a prime customer, the app keeps on having bugs. the music keeps on getting interruptions when I switch to another app (Cannot multi task).I need to be only on Amazon music app to get uninterrupted streaming. Another bug is when am streaming and press the next button the same song starts to play,I cannot change to the next song, nor does it change on it's own to the next song, I need to exit the song, go to the playlist and then change the song. And all my music is downloaded."
Amazon Music,The Mad King Komo,2,1,"It used to be amazing, but over the past 2 month I cannot use the controls on the lock screen. The music also lags/skips if the Amazon music screen is not up, it happened twice while writing this review. I've had both of these problems with my old phone, and also has been happening since I got my new Note 9 over three weeks ago. If it keeps up then I'm going to cancel my subscription because it's nearly unusable."
Amazon Music,Jen S,1,3,"Music Unlimited? MY ASS. After having songs in my playlist for over a year...they ARE GRAYED OUT, NO LONGER AVAILABLE!!! And not just a couple of songs...HUNDREDS OF SONGS that I PAY FOR the pleasure listening to and now cannot. When you check the FAQs, Amazon very matter of factly states that they were ""removed"" and are ""no longer available."" Seriously? Well, bad news, Amazon, my subscription monies are suddenly, and without warning, no longer available as well. GOING BACK TO SPOTIFY!!!!!"
Amazon Music,Ashley R,3,,"I love this app!!! So many songs and playlists! Yet recent months in the past it has been somewhat agitating: -Shuffle will only play a select group of songs (ex: I start by playing a song starting with ""I"" and the app will play songs that being with H, I J, & K.) -Songs stop playing randomly, A LOT through playback. I notice it happens at the same spot on certain songs I listen to many times. It will take some time for the songs to load up, yet sometimes they are unable to play back up again."
Amazon Music,Adam Brinker,2,,"While the service itself is great, the android app itself continues to show stability issues across versions and multiple android devices of mine.  In addition to taking forever to load my library, (even on wifi,) the app will often hang at trying to load my selection, then error out and start playing whatever is at the top of my music library.  Sometimes it even does this after the original selection was loaded and playing!  These issues follow me across devices, android versions, app updates, and even after multiple cache and data purges.  It boggles my mind how a company that sells its own android devices can publish something this bad.  I gave it 2 stars because the 2nd time I tell the app to do something, it eventually does it, so it's not outright broken, just frustrating.  I've mostly switched over to the windows app for music now, as it doesn't have these issues."
Amazon Music,Chelle Carter,1,16,I'm having flashbacks of the 80's because my music is skipping! How does digital music skip?? All playback is horrible. There are no controls for speed settings or equalizer. Please fix or advise users not to download your app.
Amazon Music,brittney Gonzales,2,,I've had Amazon Music for over a year going on 2 years. the first year was good no problems no nothing but now it's been buffering like crazy on every song. I like to listen to Amazon Music when I'm on the go but now that's it's been buffering it's been annoying as heck. it needs a new update or something. There isnt anything wrong with my internet through my phone.
Amazon Music,Chad Quinlan,1,4,"If Amazon Music were free, I'd give it 5 stars. If Unlimited were included in my Prime subscription, I'd give it at least 3 stars. But since I'm paying >$8/mo for it on top of my Prime subscription, I'm highly dissatisfied. Opening the app takes 20 seconds, time from clicking play to actually having music come out is 20-60 seconds. If there's limited data connection, it could be minutes before you can access your local/offline music library. This is absolutely ridiculous for how much I pay."
Amazon Music,Katie Smith,1,10,"Don't waste your time. the music hardly works. I've had it play, but without sound. It's supposedly downloading right now, but it hardly completes that right. Half the time when I download music, it doesn't even show that it was downloaded. I just want the simplest thing and I can't even get that. I am utterly and totally appalled and disappointed."
Amazon Music,Chuck Clough,3,,"Im a prime member so that gives me access to a portion of the library which is great but if i wanted unlimited music, as a prime member I need to pay $10 a month more in Canada. This to me seems a bit high and is essentially the same as other streaming music services. I would pay the $10 a month for a family service but not a single account service. Prime members should get a bit of a break for the unlimited service. If this changes i would rate a 5 start."
Amazon Music,Tracy Blanton,2,1,"Why do my playlists keep disappearing? After going through the trouble of making a playlist, downloading it and listening a few times it always disappears. I cancelled my subscription to another music service over the same problem and now it's happening here. I travel in areas with bad data coverage so being able to listen offline means a lot to me."
Amazon Music,Premanshu Das,3,,"The only thing that keeps me away from subscribing to Amazon Prime Music is that it doesn't support any ""Audio Equaliser"". Spotify on the other hand supports the native audio equaliser on my phone. Not that I'm here to advertise Spotify but it really is something that I want on the Amazon Prime Music app. I'll be switching from whatever music streaming app I would be using. Please consider this."
Amazon Music,ma sun,1,1,"What is there to say that hasn't already been addressed by other reviews. Same issues, same responses on how to fix, with no results. It's disappointing that despite complaints from a multitude of unsatisfied paying customers that these issues haven't been resolved. I put more faith in the stock market during a recession then trusting Amazon to troubleshoot these minor discrepancies that should have been resolved. At this point I've lost out on at least 100 dollars in digital downloads."
Amazon Music,Flynt Coal,1,8,"I'm paying for usage of this service, on top of my prime subscription. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Issue 1: Want to use the ""play this song next"" button? Aside from a satisfying vibration on my phone it does nothing. Issue 2: Have a radio that displays metadata? Well not with Amazon Music it doesn't. Issue 3: When picking a song in my offline music it will, rather than picking the song I physically selected, it will attempt and fail to play the first song alphabetically on my online music."
Amazon Music,scott gardner,3,,"It should be much better. This app has great potential, but it just misses. When I try to move music onto my phone, it is hit or miss whether it actually gets downloaded. And when I try to stream my music, it often just hangs, even when I have good connection. So my Amazon music collection is l8mited to my desktop."
Amazon Music,Allie Hopkins,1,1,Regardless of my investments so far with Amazon Music i will be switching to another music source on the near future. I pay for unlimited and experience a terrible amount of issues with the app. Songs will only play 1 at a time while casting to my music sources in my home. There are many glitches that are obvious and annoying. I use Android devices. TERRIBLE. I dont have another app that disappoints me this much.
Amazon Music,Keiths Auto,5,,"The most user friendly music app I have used. Dont be confused, music isnt free anywhere, not even church. Music artists and music industry do what they do to earn a living, just like every one else does. If 10 people are standing outside where you live complaining because they want you at work right now and do it for free, are you gonna go to work for free? Life is much easier if you do what you do to earn a living and pay others to do what they do. Stop thinking someone owes you anything."
Amazon Music,Jay S,1,1,"Got a new account and simply wanted MY music transferred to my new account so i could get rid of my old account. After a long go around with customer service i am repeatedly told that MY music apparently isn't MINE and can only be accessed and used while signed into that old account. I tried, they didn't and I'm moving on. Not that it matters to Amazon."
Amazon Music,youngjayhoffa,1,4,It would nice if I could push the play button and music plays instead of just loading and loading and loading. Tell me this what really is the point to download your music to your device if it is going to check the internet before every song is played. I love when a song is loading and loading when it is physically on the device. The worse music app
Amazon Music,Renee Wells,3,3,I enjoy the Amazon Music App however I hate that you remove music that was free and place it under the unlimited status. Many of those songs are in Playlists that provide peace of mind (in my case). I already pay for Prime I should not be forced to pay 7.99 monthly to continue to enjoy songs that initially had no unlimited price tag attached. Thank you for listening.
Amazon Music,Pack Of C4,3,1,"Pretty good overall, app is stable, music is decent enough quality, using Alexa to search for music is pretty useful, but the service could use more music, higher audio quality, and better voice recognition (doesn't recognize certain artist names??) but overall it's a nice enough service, you can download music and have access to more music with a prime membership, but needing a separate amazon music subscription for ""premium"" music is just dumb."
Amazon Music,Brad Webb,2,,"Could be a great app with a ton of music choices. Unfortunately, I keep losing saved playlists I've spent hours putting together. Customer support typically gives standard, pre-scripted trouble shooting tips but cant or wont answer specific questions. Currently, unistall and reinstall seems to be the only resolution. As a result, this app is a pain in the arse and nearly useless."
Amazon Music,Thomas Hughes,2,,"Good music selection, exceptionally poor queueing, and 'play next' no longer seems to work offline. Is it so hard to queue your own songs instead of adding them to the bottom a 500 odd long auto-queue? Also, do not uninstall and then reinstall, you'll lose all your downloaded songs and have to download again! Other than that this app is okay, good song suggestion by the app, lyrics are available and layout of app isn't bad"
Amazon Music,Kurt Miller,2,2,"It used to be good as a Prime member but, now they are pushing us to pay EVEN MORE with the Amazon Unlimited (insert REALLY angry face here). They moved many of the songs and music to the Amazon Unlimited. Before too long, i just will NOT be able to see the benefit AT ALL in bring a PRIME MEMBER. It used to mean something and have privileges but, slowly & surely, they are diminishing the benefits of being a PRIME MEMBER (insert sad face here)."
Amazon Music,Daniel Stanbridge,2,6,"Up until recently I had no issues at all however that all changed a few weeks ago, constantly stop starting music/cutting out. I thought it was my headphones to begin with which I checked my other music apps I use and they are fine, sort it out i cant be stopping every 5 minutes on my way to work to keep the music playing."
Amazon Music,Don O'Meara,3,,The Amazon Misic app is essentially a gateway to encourage you (with daily reminders!) to sign up for a Spotify lite experience with a subscription to Amazon Music. Even though you are already paying for app via Amazon Prime this only offers you a partial access to music. The app itself is a little clumsy. One extremely annoying element is it does not always present an album with the correct original track listing. Because of this problem I will never sign up fully to the subscription service.
Amazon Music,samantha rasmussen,2,2,"App stopped working for me for the past year or so it's been spotty... songs constantly stop working, even after purchasing the song.. for the past two weeks anything that's not downloaded or if I'm not on wifi it takes Forever to play the song/playlist (even with full bars) I've had to delete this app 2x already.. sadly it's one of the few apps that can be used no matter what country... which is why I still have it"
Amazon Music,Adrienne Tybjerg,3,1,"Yeah the playlists are buggy (can't edit list sometimes, doubled song entries so you can't edit one of them, play list menu needs a scroll bar so you can see all play lists you make, songs removed from Amazon get grayed out. They are often are re-listed under perhaps a slightly different name but aren't suggested.). But, I like to try out new music, I can listen across platforms on almost any computer anywhere without tying up my phone, and the music suggestions and stations are nice."
Amazon Music,Scott Marsh,2,,"music quits after a song or two if streaming, even though i'm connected to a strong wifi signal and my phone's fairly new. i asked for help but got no response. i love using Amazon's store and movies but so far it looks like i won't be renewing my free trial for music unless i get some answers and problems resolved. i could buy a record player and hear more then two songs at a time... lol Scott M."
Amazon Music,DAN BAUMGARTNER,1,8,annoying ad for premium services. I'm already paying for prime stop offering me additional services that cost. also I'm used to the way Pandora is used. i find Pandora easier. so other than usability and ads it's good. ad popped up again. ad popped up again. ad popped up again. and yet again
Amazon Music,Aviral Agrawal,1,,The worst player in terms of the ux. i have to go to the now playing screen and press play for the song to start even after clicking in it in the list. no to mention some songs don't play no matter how many times i click on them and they're not greyed out. Random songs start playing insted of the one ive clicked on in the recently added list. I'm seriously considering leaving prime just coz of this.
Amazon Music,Vance Robinson,1,2,"When it comes to shipping and shopping, Amazon has it down pact, but the music streaming not so much. I'm paying for the unlimited prime and expected better than the regular prime service. The music buffers after about 2 songs into a playlist/station whether its over WiFi or network. The signal strong on both accounts. If i switch over to Pandora or Spotify, no issues with buffering. They will get my money for premium services."
Amazon Music,Tricia T,3,3,"Most of the time I like this app, however, I have downloaded a couple of songs that stop the player after the song instead of moving on to the next song. Also, I am running into several songs that say they are no longer available in Playlist, but can be pulled up and ARE available so I have to delete and re add them."
Amazon Music,Erik Swanson,3,,"upset. did not have every single song i ever wanted namely an At The Gates song I got the highest paid version of this specifically for cuz that means everything as promised. very sad. not canceling...until 90 days free is up. will update opinion at end of 90 days. as an app developer, I see room for improvement that would help Amazon as much as if not more than us. contact me Amazon let's do this! Shameless employment request stated."
Amazon Music,Michael Joyal,2,3,Could be less buggy. Downloaded a prime song. Wanted to buy the song to keep it instead of using just prime to listen to it. Bought it thru the amazon app not the music app. But it says I downloaded it even though it isnt in my phone library. So basically I have to buy it again in the music app to have it work properly?
Amazon Music,Kenny Bennett,1,2,"shuffle BARELY shuffles. what good is it to have access to 1000s (NICE!) of artists and songs (in a playlist or station) when shuffle plays the same 10 or so over and over? finishing my basement so I'm literally listening for 10 hours per day. i am REALLY tired of same songs and artists and never getting any new ones that are in the list. seems to be starting on names because aerosmith is there first artist played nearly every time, and almost always the first song in the aerosmith album. HELP"
Amazon Music,Will Shaw,2,,Not for someone that wants to purchase music. The spam for their streaming service is annoying and if you search for a song you already own its search result shows you the streaming plan first instead of playing from your library. The interface is completely designed around their streaming stations making it very difficult to navigate.
Amazon Music,Joshua Borm,3,3,"overall there is great selection of music, including some obscure genres. however, sometimes the track order is not correct when revisiting an album. this seems to happen to double albums right after you listen to them. maybe it's an issue with local cache. i hope they look into this and fix it soon"
Amazon Music,Akash Hajnale,1,2,"I play a song. It plays for some time then it stops and keeps buffering. After I force stop and restart the app , the same process is repeated. please solve it!! Mobile info: Lg G4 H818N mobile network: idea. My internet is working perfectly fine and at high speed. Also i tried reinstalling the app . But same is repeated."
Amazon Music,Alejandro Guillen,2,,I've been using Amazon for quite a while already and for some unknown reason I'm having a huge problem with my account lately. I download my music and when I'm out and put it on online mode my music disappears and I have to keep downloading the music every morning and this has been going on for a week. I think it's time I leave Amazon Music.
Amazon Music,Stephen O,1,,"Horrible for streaming music. Continuously plays the same exact song back to back no matter how many times you ""thumbs down"" it or skip to previous or next track. Save your money and find a different music source because Amazon music is not good at all. Very irritating attempting to listen to music."
Amazon Music,Mary Halter,1,2,"I love Amazon but this app is extremely disappointing. The cue doesn't work. The music will stop after a minute playing if you lock your phone. When you download music it deletes itself every month and acts like its loading the music when in offline mode. Honestly, I rather just pay for premium on spotify because I know I'm actually getting quality"
Amazon Music,Kristi Connell,1,3,"""Prime Member"" here... they've changed so much recently. More $$ now for what you used to get as 'basic prime' member. SAVE YOUR $$$ .. DON'T DO IT. One device only. Family add-ons are extra. Prime Music will kick you off EVERY song, to confirm something you just ""confirmed"" last song. Amazon as a whole has gone SEVERELY DOWNHILL!!! ZERO STARS if it was an option. Regretting ever becoming a Prime Member."
Amazon Music,Vivia Massey,4,,"For the most part Alexa is a good app. I need to spend more time learning this app. sometimes it's hard to get the songs I want to hear to play. But what I find really helpful is when I say ""immediately"" after playing a song that I like ""Alexa play more songs like that one"" then Alexa plays most of the songs I want to hear. You can also say ""Alexa skip that song"" and it plays the next song which more than likely is what I want to hear."
Amazon Music,A Google user,3,1,Not sure why new albums is so far down now on the browse page. Also choosing browsing catagories seems to now be non existent. The only upside is downloading seems more stable than it used to be. I also find many albums still hit apple first or any specialised songs. If your happy to miss out on a few features here and there then Amazon music will be fine.
Amazon Music,Blip Ghost,3,3,"mediocre UI. Really frustrating when you're listening to a tune and simply touch an album cover or song, and it just starts playing. too often inadvertently start playing something when i didn't intent to. artwork too small to see much detail especially on classical and jazz records. sounds quality mediocre. too often hear digital noise/digital distortion so sound quality could be much improved. shouldn't have to leave the app to research album info looks album credits/personnel."
Amazon Music,A Google user,5,3,So much better than pandora!!! I love that you can have song lyrics...you can have it offline and online...you can skip as many songs as possible and you can search up thousand of song!!! this app is really amazing and I definitely recommend you download this application!!!
Amazon Music,Ian Lucas,3,,Selection of music is great when used with unlimited subscription. No issues creating playlists. Online use is fantastic. Offline use is sketchy. Even with music downloaded playback will pause at random times for no apparent reason. Disabling data connections makes no difference. Unreliable for offline use at this time.
Amazon Music,Jason Hurdlow,2,,"Works, but very slow, especially when you dont have a data connection. Developers need to properly test and make it work quickly in offline scenarios, which is where I tend to use it most. The interface isn't the best either, sometimes being confusing, and always slow. Needs a lot of work."
Amazon Music,Dawne K,4,,Great app with lots of song choices/variation. The only hiccup is if you have to stop your app ( on your phone) or unplug your Alexa device the music que starts over from the beginning. There is no way to have it continue from the last song played. If that were fixed I would definitely give it 5 Stars!
Amazon Music,Javasya Jack I,1,4,"This app used to be the best music app around...but ever since conception of ""prime"", every few months, little by little, my songs are being removed from my library. Songs I've PURCHASED are ""unavailable"" for some reason or another, without the option to repurchase."
Amazon Music,Forrest Sarrasin,1,1,"I loved the app at first, but after 3 months my playlists would not refresh even when I am on a wifi network. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that did not work. Also when using the App with android auto I am struck listening to default songs that I have tried to delete. Cancelling my sub, until this issues are sorted."
Amazon Music,patil seema,5,,"AMAZING APP. I prefer to use Amazon and it's apps due to the trust that I have gained for years. One main point is the features that help you download , create your playlists and suggestions to listen to the type of songs you would love to listen. Amazing entertainment app from Amazing Amazon. Love it."
Amazon Music,W John Burns,1,1,"Deleting the app yesterday resulted in the loss of years of music. I only wanted to re-install to troubleshoot hangs in displaying playlists & songs. Terrible. With the failures on the related streaming website, I have no idea why Amazon is declining this way. Now, countless hours trying to repopulate my phone."
Amazon Music,Eileen Rafferty,4,,"This is a good app generally. It has one supremely annoying feature, which is its insistence on trying to load up online sales and prime options when I just want to play the music that's on my phone. If the online connection is slow or down the app doesn't function properly and I have to give up."
Amazon Music,Louis Garrett,1,23,"Practically unusable. Makes unlimited subscription less valuable. Constant modal popups that beg for mobile data download permission, but it can't show me what songs it's trying to download. If I told you not to use mobile data, then don't use it and stop frackin asking me. And if you must ask, only do it once, only in the app, and show me the download queue. How can an app from this company, with their resources, be so bad?"
Amazon Music,KALEI O,2,1,"songs started to skip or spotty, I've been using this music app for the past years and recently been having lots of problems. I've lost lots of songs already downloaded and some of my playlist albums were deleted. I have been contemplating on deleting this music app and going elsewhere. POOR!!!!!"
Amazon Music,Colin Tovey,1,1,"Used to be ok. Now i can no longer use properly on my S7 due to 206 memory full issues. tried everything including uninstall/reinstall, clean/swap out memory card, log out/log in, forced stop and more. My default memory is set as my SD card which is half empty. Lookong back over other reviews and forum posts it looks like I'm stuck with. May have to cancel my family subs now unless Amazon find a fix."
Amazon Music,Brianna Casey,3,,"I love everything about it! EXCEPT, there's a coupla things I've been dealing with it. Every once in a while, it stops on it's own & also exits completely from the top notification section (I'm on android). please, PLEASE, FIX! it's getting really annoying 😖."
Amazon Music,Jake Griffith,1,2,"Consistent problems downloading music purchases. Used to work very well, but lately it's horrible. Music downloaded doesn't stay downloaded and doesn't seem to work well with other music players."
Amazon Music,Logan Fude,4,5,"Good, but has some glitches. Sometimes the app spontaneously takes you back to the beginning of the song, or doesn't allow you to seek by touching on the title of the next song. Had the same problem on my other Android device. Works great on my iPad though, no glitches."
Amazon Music,The Moore Family,1,,We are told Amazon Music is included when it really isn't. You can't listen to any current music unless you pay another monthly fee on top of your prime membership. Ridiculous!! the choice of songs are poor. I would rather pay for SPOTIFY. Do not bother with this app.
Amazon Music,Mike6688,3,8,"It's good, but a shame they have taken the ability to add your own music you already ow n away. Google music allows you to add 50,000 of your own songs completely free. As part of prime the access to songs is good, and you can normally find something you would like to listen to. The music unlimited subscription is even better, obviously, but i don't use this as I don't need it - I'm happy with what I get with Prime and use Google music for playing music I already own now."
Amazon Music,Cristian Adam,3,,"the app works for playing music, but the constant ads for music unlimited start to get annoying, even if I buy songs/albums & give thrm $$ I'm still bombarded with them - besides that the UI could use some work, for example when creating a new playlist, the +/- buttons to add/remove songs overlaps with the scroll bar, thus causing many misclicks"
Amazon Music,Rhett Jordan,3,,"Still so many problems. Song availability comes and goes frequently, music can only play on one device at a time (cannot do bedroom and living room without pairing them and listening to the same music), and songs cut short sometimes. You'd think they'd have touched this up by now"
Amazon Music,Austin Driedger,3,,"Does what you want - with skips. Only referring to OFFLINE music that I've downloaded, about 1-5x a song it will skip (as if getting a notification) (obviously I have phone on mute) There is no reason why this should happen since nothing is streaming. This happens on all 3 of my phones, galaxy S7, 8 and 9. (and yes phone + app is fully updated) PLEAZE FIX - I gave up the pirate career for this... Paying for skips is unacceptable when I could pirate quality."
Amazon Music,Thaddeus Koslik,4,,"Prime music is cool and free, but like most streeming aps, it gets you a lot of music, but the Prime Unlimited gets you more. They're always trying to get me to sign up for unlimited...Not happening. I'll take the free music that comes with my $100/year Prime membership thank you."
Amazon Music,Matthew Colford,2,2,"annoying new feature... everytime I go on to the app now and try to play a song it comes up with download over mobile network even tho I'm in the offline music section... it also comes up with stream over mobile network ... I already said no in my settings please dont ask me over and over again, it gets really annoying."
Amazon Music,Brenda Forden,2,,"Can't make playlists with more than 12 songs, my original playlist became ""recently played music"" so when I set it to random play I end up hearing the same songs many times. I've tried setting up new playlists and moving them but can only load 12 songs to a playlist. I just want my one playlist back!"
Amazon Music,Franchesca Simpson,1,1,"Crashes constantly. This app used to be a lot better. Now it just stops, drops signal, won't sync your music. If another person on you account listens yours stops even if your paying extra for ""unlimited "" it's ridiculous that you are paying for this and can't use it."
Amazon Music,Peter Knight,1,,"I have been using the Amazon Music App on different MacOS devices for year and it is brilliant. I had reason to have i on Android table n and it is just the worse experience ever. The offline music mode doesn't work, so despite having deliberately downloading music for offline listening it still wanted an internect connection. The software seems to constantly be crashing and becoming unresponsive. If I hadn't used tthe software before I'd have deleted it by now."
Amazon Music,Lee Lee,1,4,"this app is the worst. glitches all the time and when I downloaded my music back to the phone half of the songs THAT I PURCHASED won't play. get with it Amazon. Edit: so I tried to contact Amazon for help. Not only were they not helpful, every single piece of their ""troubleshooting"" I had already done TWICE and they still ""insisted"" that I do the troubleshooting. This is so bogus."
Amazon Music,SHUDHANSHU SHEKHAR SINGH,4,1,"Amazon prime music is soo good! some things might work on- •my family members add different types of music to the library and it gets played everytime i play something , a sub profile would be a great help for different family members •sometimes even when the connection is strong, the main screen top content (row) doesn't load up •music language selection (for different phones/users) would be really helpful too. one issue-It doesn't show me the music stored in my device i.e other dwnlds Thank you"
Amazon Music,Graham Bulch,4,1,"I initially gave this app 5 stars but it turns out that one album i want to listen to is not included in the free 2 million and there's not even the option to listen to it with ads ( à la Spotify), that'd be a 3.5 in my book but for the fun I'm having listening to songs uninterruptedly."
Amazon Music,A Google user,5,2,"the app is great, and I even upgraded to unlimited. however, I can't add or remove songs from my playlists. the function is there it's just not working, and it's really frustrating. also, songs (even downloaded ones) tend to skip like a scratched cd. along with that, I have an echo but the bluetooth wont connect. it only works in-app for amazon music, so I can't use the actual bluetooth doesn't work. Update: Everything has been fixed :) update 2: never mind, the skipping is worse now :("
Amazon Music,LaTease Marks,3,,The mini player locks after skipping so many songs in a row . Then I have to unlock the phone just to skip to the next song . Can't play allow my music unless I download them all. Or join Amazon music unlimited . I already pay for prime. Not spending money on that.
Amazon Music,deviantskwirrel,4,3,"My music will randomly either just stop (even with a good internet connection) or will switch songs in the middle of a song. If this gets fixed, I'll rate it 5 stars. The variety is good. And I like being able to search for music to add to my offline play lists. Just not a fan of the random interruptions, especially when I'm at the gym."
Amazon Music,David Hetheria,2,4,This app keeps asking for a review. So here's one Most of the music is still behind an additional pay wall ontop of having Amazon prime subscription. Buttons on the notification area rarely work and you need to open the app to play pause or skip to next song. Songs never buffer so if you step into a lift or go anywhere with no cell coverage you lose music.. 2 stars is generous
Amazon Music,Robert Hines,3,,"This was my favorite music app until this month , now the app buffers every couple of minutes regardless of connection . It even buffers on my downloaded / stored music. I am using a Note 8 with the latest software updates. My only other issue is not being able to delete music from playlists."
Amazon Music,Vinay Nair,3,14,its a good app but there needs to be some basic improvements for example scroll bar interferes with the options button which is very inconvenient. it should not show WhatsApp audio as songs. ignore it by default or let the user choose the music folder( in the case of offline music). idk if Equalizer is too much to ask. however the first two should be fixed asap.
Amazon Music,Ethan Porritt,3,,"Great for anyone who already holds an Amazon prime account! Massive array of sings to pick from even without the premium version: the only issue which stops me rating this higher is the fact songs which have not been purchased will be inaccessible on your device if you have not listened to them in a while, which is soul crushing when you go on go holiday only to realise your music has been deactivated"
Amazon Music,Troy Mezzell,2,,"While the app worked for quite awhile, it has gotten really bad. Shuts off constantly and the sound quality gets really gargled up. I do pay extra and will be giving up myself. Seems like enough people have complained of the issue and nothing has been done."
Amazon Music,Chris Conzola,5,,I have been using this app for about a week and I love it! the only negative is once in a while when I try to add a song to a playlist it says song is already in playlist but it's not. trying to add it again in a few minutes usually works. overall I recommend the full membership.
Amazon Music,gamer295,1,2,It feels like something out of the 1990's.It's ugly and it doesn't let you set a particular genre as your preferred. The home page is completely irrelevant if the developers dont customize it through some kind of algorithm to give you the music you want to listen to. feature like making a pre-existing play que into a playlist is missing.Terrible app
Amazon Music,Saumya Joshi,4,,"Prime music is amazing. The reason why I haven't given 5 stars is there is a glitch while changing songs via notification bar, the app stops after 5 or 6 continuous changes. then, you've to open the app and change them. if that you can resolve, ill add the missing star. keep updating :)"
Amazon Music,X YZ,1,1,Problem: if I delete an album from my Amazon Music online cloud library if the album is also on my MicroSD card it will delete it from there - Even though the duplicate album is not downloaded from Amazon its an MP3 of a CD I created. This is very annoying as it took ages to upload 800 CD's and put them on a MicroSD card to use in my mobile. Reason for duplicates is for convenience I add albums I own to my library on Fire TV. When Amazon grey out the album as unavailable I delete it.
Amazon Music,Joshua Edwards,5,1,In my opinion its one of the best music apps out there. I love the offline music feature that lets me listen to all of my music even if im not around any WiFi. Even has some of the rare obscure stuff that is generally hard to find. Keep up the good work thanks!
Amazon Music,Moksh Maurya,3,2,"saavn, ganna, SoundCloud are far more better than amazon music there are so mang songs to explore in them and the interface is good on the other hand amazon music has nothing. the one thing i hate the most is when you search a single song and play after it ends amazon doesn't play songs related to that song while other apps do. i would suggest not to download this app"
Amazon Music,ch pr,1,,"there seems to be a bug with the app whereby if you have a small amount if data signal the app doesn't work in offline mode, as it seems to be trying to connect to the internet. you have to turn off mobile data or wait until you get better signal. it just hangs otherwise."
Amazon Music,Becca Frase,4,,"Alot of songs I put in a playlist, all too soon are no longer available. For the monthly price I pay, I feel and believe that once I put an available song onto one of my playlists, it should stay there unless I remove it. I do however prefer this over Pandora."
Amazon Music,Steven Librizzi,5,7,"What's not to like, everything's laid out plain and simple very easy to use yet the app has plenty of options it's easy to search for artists and discover new artists and reasonable prices if you want to stream or buy song or albums."
Amazon Music,ASFAK KHATRI,2,1,Needs many improvements... 1.The music stops when we close all apps from task manager. no music player does that. please fix this. 2. its 2nd biggest no. of music still missing so many songs from smaller artist. (i couldn't find 'wake up' by jenny owen youngs and 'bulleya' from Sultan Movie...🧐) 3. Songs sometimes do hiccups(even the downloaded ones.)
Amazon Music,Jorge Sanchez,3,1,"While navigation is straightforward, the search algorithm of doesn't yield any results using a partial string, and then does fing the song using the complete string. Also, many remixes I find on Youtube, are not in the Amazon collection. For these shortcomings, I rate this app and experience low."
Amazon Music,Chukwunonso Muonagolu,3,,"i really like the outlook and design but it feels very underdeveloped. it can be a bit difficult to navigate. also for some reason you cannot delete whole albums. just individual songs from your my music. the app has a long way to go, but seems promising."
Amazon Music,Matt Thomson,2,2,i have been enjoying this app until recently when it is struggling to stream to other devices. It appears to link initially and then after maybe 2-3 songs the stream fails. Pretty poor for auch an expensive subscription.
Amazon Music,Lewis Hill,2,1,"Often looses my downloaded music, often unable to download. Just fails for no apparent reason. Very frustrating. Expected better. On the plus side it's easy to navigate and find lots of songs and i like the various playlists it's suggests for me."
Amazon Music,Adam Bradshaw,1,2,"Has to be the worst music subscription app out of all of them. No favorites list, no way to add stations to your playlists, no way to organize your music, ugly blue interface, horrible android auto interface, etc. I just hate the way this app works very frustrating to use."
Amazon Music,Mieszka Pittsley,1,1,"When I stream music, the app stops and I get a ""Amazon Music error"" but when I select the option to send the error logs to Amazon for trouble shooting, their mailbox is full. I have followed all of the trouble shooting steps I found, but to no avail."
Amazon Music,Rick James,4,,"Please fix family unlimited access set up. All over a great App, superior sound quality and Alexa helps me find anything I desire. You have provided hours of fantastic music and memories. I am looking forward to discovering more artists, since you also make great reccomendations."
Amazon Music,AKSHAY KUMAR,3,,"thumbs up for music quality. Need to fix lags. Can add an entire playlist to my music, but can delete only one song at a time, need to fix this. I select one song and it plays another songs, some times it happens like this, need to fix this."
Amazon Music,Judy Kushner,4,2,"I do love Amazon Music Unlimited, great interface and ease of making playlists. One negative, actually an omission that can be easily addressed, is that there needs to be a category listing that denotes the style of music each artist is, the way iTunes does it."
Amazon Music,Tim Knight,1,2,Like Kindle has become progressively worse. If you wish to play your paid-for music off line it takes forever to find the artists as tge app tries to guide you towards more stuff to buy. Tracks often drop out for about a second too. I intend to look elsewhere.
Amazon Music,carrie shevlin,3,,Adequate-i don't like how music i downloaded to my phone is suddenly removed so that i can't listen to it offline even though i did have it downloaded. and i don't like that i can't organize my library into playlists without downloading songs a second time (it seems).
Amazon Music,FLA TRAILRATED,3,,"I love the music service but only like the mobile app. i would prefer to have additional functionality similar to iTunes, for example the ability to import music into my mobile library. The desktop allows for this, but not the mobile app."
Amazon Music,Jeff Johnson,3,3,The back button is broken. It should set the play position to the beginning of the currently playing song. Instead it selects the previous song in the playlist and starts playing it from the beginning. This is so annoying and is totally broken!!! Please please fix this and keep it fixed in future versions of the app.
Amazon Music,Heather Schuetz,3,,"the latest update is giving me issues with the app not loading, whether I'm using data or wifi. I have to close the app out completely and reopen it several times to get it to load. sometimes it stops playing between songs and I have to restart the app."
Amazon Music,Tiffany,3,,"Just recently stopped working. It now lags or doesn't let me choose anything on the screen. It's difficult to get it closed after it's opened. Guess I'll have to cancel my subscription. I've already reinstalled twice. used to work so well, they must have changed some things."
Amazon Music,Vaibhav Arora,1,1,"It's a very much buggy app. it's a paid service with Amazon prime, and expectations are high but it's not even meeting standard criteria of playing service smoothly. it stops playing if I pause once and I am not even able to report this issue from app."
Amazon Music,K K,2,1,"Forced to purchase the monthly streaming description. I want to search for music and purchase what I want and not have to have internet to listen to it. It is hard to find music and listen to the song, the app keeps bringing up the streaming service."
Amazon Music,Brian Reid,3,,"App frequently changes/restarts my song back to one specific song from my ""downloaded"" playlist, even when I've chosen something entirely different. It is very frustrating. Good choices in music overall, but not a fan of the bugs in the app."
Amazon Music,Mike Sprosty,1,1,this app used to be good but now it is garbage. I have been paying for the plan where i can play music on all of my Amazon devices now in the past 2 days whenever I am listening to music ads start popping up interupting my music. I will be cancelling my subscription.
Amazon Music,Greg Kaufman,4,1,"I like it. It seems to work well. However, there does not seem to be a way to load music that I already own onto it so that I can listen to my own music through this app. Perhaps that happens after you complete the 30-day trial, but I'm not sure. There should be more clarification about that when you sign up for the 30-day trial. Other than that I'm happy with it."
Amazon Music,Bill Waters,4,5,Have issues when playing from my SD card. Update: SD issue seems to be ok now. Still disappointed I can't store my own music on Amazon. Overall the app works well.
Amazon Music,Scott Allen,4,,"This is a pretty good app for listening to music. There is a great selection of music and they also have a pile of great stand up comedy albums. In fact, most of the comedy shows I've listened to I had never heard of before I selected them from the app. Check it out. You won't be disappointed."
Amazon Music,Donald Blankenship,4,,I love this app. The only issue is sometimes a song I have added to My Music is no longer available on my phone if I take it out if My Music. The rest of the songs on the CD are there and sometimes you can find it in a playlist and add it back to My Music.
Amazon Music,Chyna Irvin,1,1,"I'm pretty sure when you cannot afford a music package deal, you can listen to radio stations for FREE! And you're telling me I cannot even do that without paying something! Baloney!!! Do not ever expect me to download this again!!! 🤨🙄"
Amazon Music,Jacklyn Hee-yun KIM,1,1,"After update, my music offline mode became complete garbage. Won't play music I downloaded even though I'm on unlimited. They are just so bad at categorizing music so that it frequently messes up my entire saved music. Very sick of this problem. I hope they fix it asps."
Amazon Music,Sun S,1,1,"Alexa Never responds to me. maybe 20%. The darn app shuts down constantly. Just crashes, freezes up, and when I manually close it and get rid of excess garbage it still does same thing definitely needs to be fixed especially when it is not free."
Amazon Music,Nick Toothman,1,3,I have to force quit multiple times a day because it just shows a spinning wheel when I try to browse offline music. This used to work much better.
Amazon Music,SGTN00BIAN,4,,"It's pretty good especially since YouTube is hammering us with ads now. I dont know how much more you get out of not only paying for Prime but then paying for the ""better"" Amazon music but the one you get for being a prime member is solid."
Amazon Music,Darius Bunch,2,1,this app is a money grab. I already subscribe to Amazon Prime but they want more money to get another level music subscription. I could understand new music but Amazon decides to block out many tracks on older albums. Money better spent with a Pandora or Spotify subscription!
Amazon Music,Jacob mull,3,2,"A lot of music just disappears. You can't play a ton of stuff you think should be available....other then that the streaming is pretty flawless. So,there's that."
Amazon Music,johnathan Fields,1,2,"already paying alot of money for prime now they want more for music, and videos. prices go up year over year and offerings go down year over year thanks for the let down."
Amazon Music,Steve Kirby,5,,"Unbelievable amount of features; Favorites, offline listening, great recommendations based on search has led to discovery of similar groups I have never heard but have come to like, sleep feature, linked right in to Alexa, and many other features I am missing."
Amazon Music,corneliusrodes,5,7,I've been using this app for over a year now and love it. Really easy to use and find music. You can use Alexa to search too. I use mine with my Android phone and Apple iPad and both work seamlessly. I usually link my Bose bluetooth speaker to either my phone or iPad. Good value too if you subscribe to Prime.
Amazon Music,D N,3,3,most of the time it's great and I really like it. But Amazon music has a tendency to just lock up and stop playing. there doesn't seem to be a solution available.
Amazon Music,Rob Markham,1,2,"app used to work fine, now when playing music it randomly pauses for about 2-3 seconds and continues playing. This happens 3-4 times per song, and has turned this app unusable for me due to the annoyance. Spotify, Pandora, google music dont do this. Just Amazon music."
Amazon Music,RAFAEL CARMONA,5,,"I really Like being able to see the Lyrics to the music playing along with the Music. I haven't come across any other music apps that do that. To me, that's probably got to be the best Feature of this APP. I definitely like it so far."
Amazon Music,thena barnes,2,1,stopped working. i pay for unlimited misic and within the past few months there have been issues where the songs take forever to load or just wont play at all. I its noy my service i can watch YouTube all day long but can't listen to more than 2 songs without a 10 pause waiting gor it to load.and as of today when i try to skip a song nothing happenes.im cancelling yhis service now.
Amazon Music,Christi C,3,,"This app needs serious help. Moving music to playlists doesnt work and adding stations to a playlist should be an option in this day of bluetooth/hands free driving. It also NEEDS a way to distinguish users within a household instead of everyone's taste lumped into "" my mysic""."
Amazon Music,Drake Fenway,3,,"I'm a Prime member and it's a real turn off when Amazon is always trying to upsell me to Unlimited... kind of diminishes the value of the Prime membership for me. Still ok to find some songs from an artist you may ne looking to hear, better than nothing!"
Amazon Music,Jim Bott,4,,The music selection is good. the app seems to be missing some of the functionality of competing service's apps. too much emphasis on the store to buy more and not on the streaming service that you are currently subscribing to.
Amazon Music,Kevin Couvillon,2,1,"Stops several times per song to load even with downloaded songs, kicks me out every once in a while. Sometimes even takes forever just to play a song at all. Stops playing if i get a message in. lots of little things like that."
Amazon Music,Mark Hamburg,5,,"Using the prime portion of Amazon Music has been a treat i like the Alexa feature in the widget . I'm thinking about the upgrade, music is important to me and I can see its also important to you if you're reading this."
Amazon Music,Colin Morrison,1,,"Apparently I have 2 separate profiles inside my profile as every 3 months my playlists are different, sometimes disappearing for months at a time. This forces me to completely revamp or have to rebuild all of my playlists every three months."
Amazon Music,Jerylin Huertas,1,2,Crashes too much when i turn my screen off my phone. Also crashes when i am using another app while having this one run in the backgound. Thats not fair considering i pay monthly for unlimited music.
Amazon Music,Gene Schirmacher,5,2,If I want to listen to a particular song it is easy to the select the song with Amazon music. Their genre selections of current music and well mixed. You can also listen to a full album if you desire. Impressive!
Amazon Music,Kirsty M,1,1,"Temperamental, cuts out all the time, I only use this app because I have to - Amazon is where all my music sits AND I'm a prime member so I didn't want to sign up for another music service. The app is so bad though :("
Amazon Music,Peter Harris,2,3,It seems like Amazon is trying to push their Unlimited program and get more money each month. Prime used to get you a lot of good music. Now you might get one or two songs from an album and an ad for unlimited if you want to hear anymore.
Amazon Music,Ryan Williamson,3,,the selection of music is on par with spotify but like all other music services I've tried (other than spotify) there are no daily mix's or song radio's. I vowed not to go back to spotify after my email address and password was leaked but there use of algorithms really does make them tqhe best.
Amazon Music,Mark Nuttall,1,3,"Still no way of consistently excluding directory hierarchies in Offline Mode. Inclusion of a .nomedia file in the directory path sometimes works, but not always. This results in a cluttered presentation with unwanted ""music"" files, podcasts, etc. on display. Rescanning can randomly make the problem worse or better, but you won't know which until you do it. This App is getting no more stars from me until this issue is addressed. You've also recently made it harder to find new releases by genre"
Amazon Music,Greg Gallego,4,9,"Good selection of songs, there is a noticeable gap in my preference of songs but overall one of the better services. The bigger issue that I have with Amazon's service is the constant rotation of existing songs which causes songs to become unavailable that are in my library. It will cause you to re-add to your library for online streaming. Not a problem if you have a small library or just listen to stations but for larger libraries it turns into a maintenance chore."
Amazon Music,Charles Whitford,1,1,Constant bugs. It crashes or just stops playong. Will randomly remove music sayong its not available anymore until ypu check the artist and have to add the same album/song back after removing it from ypur music. I used it while rofing a motorcycle and its infuriating to have ot stop playing after riding a block or two. Just terrible...
Amazon Music,Ecchi Angel,1,1,"It randomly won't show songs I've purchased in my library. Even when you hit ""see song in library"" it takes you to your list and that song will just be missing. Even uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't fix it. Terrible unreliable app."
Amazon Music,Kunal Sanyal,2,,"the recent playlist has real list load issue. I click on one song and some other song in the list starts playing. if your testers have not caught this, you should pay his amount to me. Moreover, there is no remove option from recent playlist."
Amazon Music,Andrea Hughes,5,13,"it's an app that does what you want. I enjoy Amazon music. you can do a lot like download songs over the cloud, make your own play list, purchase songs. so it's cool. but the library isn't as vast as apple's library is. yep I call Amazon out. bring more music like sound tracks and what not."
Amazon Music,Robduino Ash,1,1,Dreadful. it's all about Amazon trying to sell me stuff and push their agenda. No I DON'T want Alexa listening to me all the time- is that a crime? Why can't I just listen to the music I've paid for. ????
Amazon Music,Edge Edge,2,,"changes your play lists, constantly changing music to unlimited so you have to pay extra to listen to songs you've already been listening too. was a great app 2 years ago, now it's not worth the memory space."
Amazon Music,Jamie Burke,2,1,I've used Spotify for the past 5 years and only changed to this because I have a Prime account. I don't like it because you can't search for random playlists of similar music. it only shows actual albums or singles.
Amazon Music,Research Master,1,1,all kinds of problems with this new update. won't even play the song I click on and it keeps playing another song I played previously. Pretty much unusable at this point! Please fix or i wont be paying for much longer
Amazon Music,aLbert corraLez,4,,"//[overaLL good,,,however when in Landscape mode on a samsung phone, the shuffLe icon was not viewabLe on top,,,required turning to portrait mode to see icons on top when in pLayList mode,,,wiLL see if this update has repair,,,thank you for apps,products and services,,,aLL appreciated,,,];"
Amazon Music,Taleisha Thiele,2,,works great until it doesn't. App randomly decides that it has problems registering my device after I've been listening for for a while. I follow the instructions to fix it and then it happens again shortly after.
Amazon Music,Ben Line,4,,Mostly fantastic. Playlists are brill and loads of great music is easily available. Only downside is that some great songs lose access and if you can't get what you want you have to pay the extra subscription.
JioSaavn,Sambhav Gulla,4,696,"i bought pro version and i am not able to download music it just shows ""download in progress"" for a long time. I did not expect this to happen before I bought the pro version.. Whats the difference between normal and pro version if you cant download the songs??! Please fix it ASAP. PS Problem was fixed after update"
JioSaavn,Karan Anand,5,5659,"I really loved the app and very happy with the implementation of new lyrics update. The app is almost perfect, but I have a suggestion. The app is a bit cluttered right now as compared to youtube music and spotify. You guys should improve the overall UI of the app to be much more minimalistic just like the rival apps. Just like spotify's artwork tab which has behind the lyrics tab, you may have similar way of showing lyrics. The player UI should be a bit seemless and minimalistic."
JioSaavn,nidhi raman,1,8434,"Worst experience! After upgrading you old jio music you cannot enjoy any music offline. Plus the as usual subscription issue. I mean why there is the use of the upgraded version when it sucks. The old one was best! Please you people get out of the capitalist zone who is always looking for profit, profit and profit!"
JioSaavn,Nithin srivatsav,4,379,"The latest version of the app has a bug. No songs can be downloaded. But the lyrics feature is good. Tried sending an email, but there isn't any response as such. Hence to the the review section to inform about the bug. Will change once issue is resolved."
JioSaavn,Bettina biju,1,173,"A very bad experience over all. 1. After logging in again for the second time, lost my entire playlist. Had to add from the beginning. They say there is complete transfer of songs but it's a lie. 2. When you like a song, it does not get added to your ""Songs"" list. That's the basic requirement for a music app which JioSaavn does not fulfil. 3. A lot of popular music is available once and then becomes unavailable. Their ads are a lie."
JioSaavn,Sumeet Nayyar,2,144,I am not able to login into my jiosaavn account. I am having pro account . when ever I try to log in it says error. I was having my all favorite songs. I also tried to contact to care but nothing happened. this is my favorite music app and I have also spent money for pro. this is my humble request to the team for helping me out
JioSaavn,Aftab Alam,2,88,"Writing this review after upgrading to pro and using it for couple of days: - App is great that's why I upgraded to pro version, but as soon as I became a pro customer the aap started to crash. - Now no matter which song I play whether its downloaded or online, the song automatically gets paused, whether I stay on the app or it's running in the background. So guys it's my honest opinion don't waste your money on pro version, not worth it, rather enjoy the free version."
JioSaavn,Muzzammil Kazi,5,231,With the new lyrics feature(will get better with updates) . This app is out there with the best. Keep improving guys. Only thing left for my need is the launch of this app for android auto. Hope that's comes out soon.
JioSaavn,Prasanna Rane,5,303,"Pathetic. Purchased one year plan and started downloading songs, but they got stuck in a loop every time I tried it. Be it on Wi-Fi or data. Very disappointed. I hope you guys have a solution for this otherwise this will be a very bad experience for me and then I'll have to switch to Apple Music. p.s they fixed the downloading bug. Everything's great now. Thanks JioSaavn team!"
JioSaavn,Nishant Mishra,2,210,"At first, it was all to be called good. i added songs by hearting them and listened to them all time. i downloaded them. then my free trial time went off and it stopped and started to play songs online. i said ""okay, no problem. this would use only some data."" but then in between i stopped and started to give ads after each songs i played. this is so annoying. ads after one or two songs! i think saavn was better at its own and jiomusic at its own. what this is? yes, it is jiosaavn full of ads!😡"
JioSaavn,Sayati Tarafder,3,277,"Plz make the jiosaavan app free to all the jio users, then we will be able to set jio tunes and download the latest songs!! ...we already subscribed to the complimentry free of all the jio apps!.... The major issue i am facing is that m not able to download any song using the mobile data of jio, its taking very long time, so i completed my download using the wifi, plz fix this issue!! Needs update! Overall now it has a wide collection of songs, add more to it.. Nice going jiosaavan♥️"
JioSaavn,sarita das gupta,1,283,"its a worst app. i tried wynk n gana. com earlier. after getting one month pro subscription still i m unable to download musics. Evrytime whn i press download music, it asks me to get a pro subscription which i already have. i am unable to visit my earlier download list. it only ask me one thing, that is Log in. i also tried it. but no results. only ask me to get a pro subscription 😠"
JioSaavn,Nisha vishwakarma,1,277,"i don't like it .... it's a kind of force and pressure u r putting to update it, i don't want this new jio saavn, because i m unable to get those offline songs what i was liked to listen earlier and for this i know that i will have to pay an amount for getting jio saavn pro ...i find it so wrong that u r pressurising us to update it rather than using the older one if we like it..."
JioSaavn,WhoopWhoop [ Full Entertainment Blog ],4,79,"Everything is great. But I need history to be more familiar. If Jiosaavn just add history playlist on home page, that would be lot lovelier. History is there but not well maintained. I listen to a song and sometimes it don't come in history. HOPING, JIOSAAVN will listen to its users. Thanks!!!🤘🤘🤘"
JioSaavn,ravinder singh,5,86,"I'm couple of music apps in my phone, I used to use GANAAN app mostly, but when I started using JIO SAAVN app, 1st-very easy to navigate, 2nd- the quality of sound from my woofer is very nice and there is no problem when I turn the volume to maximum! 3rd-All latest songs are available on the app, there are n number of music and entertainment. 4th-Jio tunes and jio number configuration is awesome. 5th-I don't have anything to say but I love this app and an individual will also start. Thanks JIO"
JioSaavn,A Google user,3,85,"Request you to please provide a way to manually remove devices for the users, just like how Netflix and Amazon does! Right now we have to send mail and it is difficult to remember Device Identity. Note - The customer care was very prompt in resolving the issue but again the application would be better with such a feature which comes under ease of use and a better turn around time in problem resolution"
JioSaavn,sudip ghosh,3,26,"this app is undoubtedly very good. But the only problem is i cant set my jio tune. Every time when i am going to set jio tune, it says there must be a problem in your jio tune settings but i am 100% sure that eatch and evry settings is ok. this is why i am giving 3 out of 5. otherwise i'll give 5 out of 5."
JioSaavn,Radhakrishna Upadhyaya K,3,32,"I really enjoyed this app. A person who listens to many languages from English, Hindi, Malayalam and Kannada; this app has been a great one with lot of collection and variety in it at the same time. The suggestions are pretty good I have to say after trying many different music apps. I don't understand, why I don't get free subscription even after buying the larger packs on Jio! Apart from this, the recent update really made this app worse, it consumes lot more RAM than before and is laggy."
JioSaavn,Chetan Melanta,2,75,After updating jiosaavn my satisfaction level towards this app is decreasing tremendously. never expected that this app will also get those worst advertisements. it actually irritates when you are listening songs and all of a sudden when u change song those irritating ads popups. DISGUSTING & the worst part is it actually as for subscriptions if you don't want those ads. now you cant even listen offline songs. FIX THIS. Not appreciating this app at all. this app WAS my favorite but now 👎👎👎
JioSaavn,Ashish Barick,3,3,"2 reasons for the 3 stars... 1) Can't view the app on lock screen. Have to unlock the phone each time i want to do anything with the music. 2) Can't like the music/add to my music from notification scroll/lock screen. Again, I have to open the app and do it. Basically, one has to open the app for every small thing. Very frustrating. Would definitely be a 5 star if these basi were things are fixed."
JioSaavn,Sarvarth Jain,1,3,"The app was good before two things happened- 1.until it wasn't breaching my privacy by recommending the exactly same song I've been humming a while ago. And it did not happen just once. 2. It seems fine that it doesn't provide the facility to download the songs for normal users. But atleast provide the separate section to access the favourite songs. So, these two changes would have made it the perfect music app."
JioSaavn,Dinesh Kumar,1,,"There are lot of problems with this app. There is no way or deauthorizing devices. if you need to, you need to email saavn by clicking on contact us and typing a email to remove device. Also, there are no replies for the emails that i have sent. i am a pro user, who cant download any audio due to all these reasons. once, you are subscribed to pro, there is no escaping the days or refund of money."
JioSaavn,The finite infinity,3,35,"not much as expected , no crossfade, no song recognizing technology , jio tune not available for certain songs , a small trail period for jio users ( surely change the review to 1 star if not made free ) , no student offer , podcasts can be given as to show or not . Good UI but can be made better for use, No sleep time . Will change to 5 star when alo the peoblems are resolved."
JioSaavn,Biplab Ghosh,2,25,Controls and UI is 100% awkward. 50+ Million songs! Every 2nd song I search here is not found. So stop Bragging about 50+ M songs. Worse than Amazon Prime Music. 1 option is there which is useful and that is the lyrics. But the lyrics are not synchronized properly. Also there is no option to report about that matter. Audio quality is over all good. Not more than that. Price is too less for 1 year. For Bollywood only people it's a fine music app. So giving 2 stars.
JioSaavn,Varun M. Chaturmutha,1,6,"Enacting a skit where the ""Saavn Pro"" hero kills off the devil ""ad"" is a sad way of making people pay for ads. At least give me real ads and not an ad of the app itself. Banner adverts were still okay, but this has gone too far off. I don't usually write reviews, but you guys got me. Will uninstall this pain of an app once I transfer my songs to a better app."
JioSaavn,Faisal Javid,3,60,Please fix the music player of this app..... Whenever I try to shuffle my songs .. It shuffles in a particular way and never makes random songs to play ... it really sucks everytime....... Everytime I try to shuffle songs I kinda remember which song is gonna come next ....... have to manually change the song... please fix this please... make the algorithms more random ✌️✌️ Otherwise Very good app for music ..❤️❤️
JioSaavn,Usha Pokhariya,5,3,"I amount to a few minutes walk away with a new job is posted by Tony, but it would like to see if the charge at the end up to the new York city of Edinburgh for your reply, I will not only that the company, which is why the the same way, and a bit like to see you all know how you doing with the new one is in my job file view the property has to be a problem for the delay, but it would like any further information on the way to get the cheapest prices on new and used the same time."
JioSaavn,GULSHAN KUMAR CHOUDHURY,3,19,"I used to love it, until I was not able to play songs using wifi. Suppose, my data is over then this app is useless. You guys are forgetting the basics of music, it should free you, not bind you."
JioSaavn,Sakunjay Vyas,1,35,I just subscribed to saavn pro...but I am not able to use it as I have signed in with same account on multiple devices...but I no longer have access to those devices...and saavn is not giving any option regarding their de-authorization...I have also shared my feedback regarding the problem through a mail...but there is no response till now.
JioSaavn,sarabjit singh,2,20,everyone needs new latest songs for jio tunes but no songs of new movies are added... I have emailed them to add songs of punjabi movie dil diyan gallan.. and make sure they can be set on jio tunes. I know they will not add the songs on their customer request. because their is 0 customer service in jio tunes.. whenever we call on customer care they always say maafi chahte hai te song nyi lag payega .. slow people
JioSaavn,Rowdyy Ronnie,1,3,Search option doesn't work properly. Most of the time it keeps searching and doesn't even show a single result even though I know the song/album/artist is available on JioSaavn library. And it doesn't matter if I use wifi or 4G. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. But the problem still persists.
JioSaavn,Sateesh Sat,4,22,I am a music lover.... the songs and the sound quality is very good... i am requesting the developer that can you please add some additional sound effects such as surrounded sound... extra base ... 3d sound... and other equaliser tools . i am using jet audio player currently in that effects are very very good ...you can look into that thank you
JioSaavn,Kaustubh Sharma,1,4,Worst Jio App ever used since I've been using Jio services. Jio music was much better than this one. Most of the the songs which were there on Jio Music are not available and we can't even download music for offline playback. This app now doesn't even eligible to a single star. I wish if jio music is available again on play store.. Highly disappointed from this app!!
JioSaavn,JITENDRA RAWAT,1,69,wastage of time with every new update ...i m shocked why jio music is updated to jio saavn which is worst than ever...why it forces for new update ..hate it worse than ever..new update having no sequence of songs and it is not grouped plzz provide best playlist nd options to play songs more conveniently..too much ads bored of this app ..is this only way to earn money for the jio company ??? hate this app want money nd too much ads why pro version ....going to unstall it.. getting too much bored.
JioSaavn,Aman Sahu,4,37,"Best Music Service in India. The recent update with lyrics in built is so neat. Makeover is needed in notification when music is played. It kinda looks ancient. (Take inspiration from Spotify or Wynk). When the User Interface is neat and beautiful, it feels refreshing to listen to on it."
JioSaavn,Charlton Dsouza,5,20,"Have been using Saavn for a while and it's been a wonderful experience so far. The podcasts, the playlists are superb and with the new lyrical update it's raised the bar. The collection is amazing, from old to new tracks & being a Jio user It's gives me the freedom to preview and set a ringtone right away. Worth 5 stars! Kudos JioSaavn Team."
JioSaavn,debasish sahu,1,81,Almost all songs are unavailable to set as jio tune. Sometimes it takes time to play a new song. Worst app. Try to improve it.
JioSaavn,Prabhudutta Srichandan,4,38,Overally app provides huge variety and collection of songs even the quality is undoubtedly far more better than other music app's. The only thing it lags is limited options for jio tunes . Please team try to work on this and provide us with options. I am personally facing an issue with the app. I am not able to play the songs in background. Whenever i minimise the app the song stops playing . Could you guys please look into this also.
JioSaavn,priyanka pundeer,1,21,"worst app ever. I can't change my ringtone as the songs I want to put as ringtone, they aren't available. why Jio collar with Saavn. it's pathetic that one cannot put her favourite song as ringtone. useless app ever."
JioSaavn,Vishwanath Biswal,5,23,"Wow.. This is an amazing application. It's UI looks so cool as compared with Jio Music. Wonderful updated version. One of the best thing that I like in this new version is that while listening to songs, meanwhile we can also read the lyrics of that song(in built option). Amazing ..!!"
JioSaavn,Chinmay Mandal,3,47,"Day by day advertisements are increasing, either go for paid saavan or let it be. Functions are smooth but difficulties comes with relative searches, randomly recommends anything. You'll most of the songs but 'll not get songs which are out of the box like kygo remix and trance remix. App is worth 3 and a half star and ofcourse there is a chance of improvement in every interface therefore i'm giving 3."
JioSaavn,Syed Sheesh Jilani,3,,everything is good in this app expect one thing that is when i downloaded the songs and want to listen them offline it shows that there is a problem with the song while playing offline plz download it again. This type of problem is very irritating. Maybe 2or3months ago i have downloaded more than 200songs but when i tried to listen them offline most of the songs had shown that problem and i have to download again more than 100songs. but still that problem exists plzz fix this problem
JioSaavn,Sagnik Saha,2,26,Its a overall a good app but these things should be corrected: 1. I cannot play an offline music file from the file explorer. I have to open the app to play those. add a feature of playing offline songs directly 2. Every song is in placed in an album with no other songs. it adds an unneccessary extra step to play a song. Please correct this issue. 3. Please add a feature of editting the queue directly when i open it. 4. please add a feature of adding offline songs in queue/playlist.
JioSaavn,Soni Das,3,,I have been using JioSaavn Music App for past many months in my Samsung Galaxy A8 plus mob and was quite satisfied. Sadly since last fortnight it was unable to get update. When I tried to reinstall even worse it is not getting installed anymore in my mobile. Please help as don't want to lose this awesome music app.
JioSaavn,Karthika Radhakrishnan,1,66,"Worst Lyrics for malayalam music, nobody can understand it. Each word is mixed with both with malayalam and manglish,and obviously with lots of spelling mistakes which will even change the entire meaning.Atleast please disable the lyric option for malayalam songs, so that you don't kill our language or else make sure it is accurate to an extend."
JioSaavn,Pranav Gupta,2,43,"Doesn't work properly on my One plus .The song automatically stopped after playing 4 to 5 seconds and the app also get closed. Please fix this or I'll download Spotify or Amazon music,which is better i think"
JioSaavn,Alice Ho,1,64,I have subscribed to saavn premium. And all of a sudden all my downloaded songs have went missing and I cant go offline and listen to these tracks. what kind of a bug is this?
JioSaavn,Tanishq Mehta,1,30,hello team I have paid 299 subscription but after 1 day only when I logged out and again logged in app is telling to login which I am unable to and even after that when it's logged in it is telling to buy subscription to be a pro member pls help.. many times even after login they ask to login again.. mailed so much times but no reply...
JioSaavn,karuturi sumanth,1,3,"already we had saavn ,jio saavn is useless.Most of the songs are unavailable to set as callertune then this app makes no sence .As a jio user we can't have paid subscription for free ( even the free subscription for few days is not available for previously existing saavn users Also some tracks are unavailable (eg: ""1 nenokkadine @telugu track"", 'to be human by sia"" etc,."
JioSaavn,Bhushan Shirsat,4,34,"Please make arrangements to move songs from internal memory to sd card, because for HD songs so much of internal space is consumed that its getting a bit difficult to manage this. else loving this app and quality of songs."
JioSaavn,yasir arafat,1,17,"I am trying to unsubscribe to the app for last two months but am unable to. please help. when i press unsubscribe, it opens the subscription window but just stays there. I look forward to your response"
JioSaavn,Karant Agrawal,1,3,Such a waste this app is everytime its auto stopping after seconds and then I have to start it again. total waste. now my downloaded songs are also not available and even lyrics are not visible. do something. why don't you release the new update without any bugs?
JioSaavn,Vinesh Basnate,1,45,"Just got worst after collaboration with Saavn, the old Jio music was much better than it, infact there was something good for jio prime membership, if this is we have to get, than why we switched to jio, if even after that prime membership, we have to pay more for music. they even do not allow me to listen my downloaded songs, what is this. As many of the people had requested, I too requesting to become jio music again, leave saavn.... ""yaha dard k siwa kuchh nai h"""
JioSaavn,dharmesh minat,1,29,Why subscription for Jio users? It should have been a better partnership deal beneficial for jio users and not making people use to the app and one day all of a sudden asking for subsricption fees. Make it Jio music all again. Savaan sucks. 💩
JioSaavn,Bishal Chetri,2,,"You guys shouldn't have collaborated with saavan .It sucks now.Jio Music used to be my favourite music app but not anymore.As far i know the services of Jio all comes under the monthly or yearly plans that one pays then why to put bunch of stupid ads,i know thats an earning trick if jio music is now trying to pump money out of people then kindly reduce the price of data packs, the upgrade seems now to be an actual downgrade of its true essence."
JioSaavn,Pranav Shah,1,,looters....Really disappointed with jio now a days......Jio is charging us for prime rs99 for all jio apps. now they have discontinued Jio Music in which we were able to download unlimited songs from the day they have bought saavn everything is chargeable. then why u guys charge us 99 for. this is just a start. we need jio music back with unlimited download for which we are already paying 99 for all jio app subscription
JioSaavn,A Google user,1,1,"worst experiance ever,it is far better when it was just jio music,after fusion with saavn this app has become very bad,ads comes after every song,and download feature was also gone,and for download and removing ads they ask money while when it was just jio music every feature is free and ads were also not there,please jio split apart with Saavn"
JioSaavn,Koushik Datthu,4,,"This app is good to set the caller tune for jio users , i had one issue to tell , the lyrics of the song is showing in dzz app is hav mistakes , i cant understand some lyrics which is showing in app.. Except dzz issue , dzz app is perfectly gud & useful.. Tnx for providing dzz kind of app... But plzz make sure this issue to solve.."
JioSaavn,Amrita Roy,1,30,"worst experience... it's just not working completely... installing and uninstalling again and again but still it's not working, what's wrong with this app?"
JioSaavn,Vikas Choudhary,3,14,"The app is quite good but every song I want is not there. Kindly update it with more songs and more old movies songs. Everyone looks out for an app which should have every song a person ever listened or heard somewhere. And yes keywords, it does not search right keywords which we search so let it search some related words which a person can type wrong sometimes. Good Luck."
JioSaavn,megha barthwal,1,16,Disliking a song in the mid of any radio doesn't makes this app understand the genre which is disliked.. Still playing same stupid songs after several disliked songs.. Love notes radio plays old songs.. what is the meaning of categorizing 80's and 90's separate radios when you wanna play these songs in this category.. Hate this app now..
JioSaavn,Pranay Kumar,5,2,"The BEST app ever!!! this app becomes best bcoz of its new feature the ""lyrics"" one this is just awesome.I was just wishing if this app could have a feature of sharing songs to PC,it would have been more fun.But however I believe that these guies have improved a lot and will maintain this. 😄😄😄"
JioSaavn,A Google user,1,23,Get you act right guys.. A customer who has registered for 1 year Pro subscription won't like to see 'Activate Pro' on the Menu. It's confusing as it also displays 'Pro' with number of days left.
JioSaavn,Pritesh Patel,1,38,I am a pro user before Saavn was acquired by Jio... The older Android app before Jio was working fine with Android Auto in my Hyundai Creta. Now this new JioSaavn app is not working with Android Auto and ruined my daily commute experience in my car!!! Why the Android Auto support is not there in new JioSaavn app?
JioSaavn,Saurav Chanda,2,,"The search function keeps hanging every now and then. In spite of getting a pro version, updated app, the search function still doesnt work. And yes, I've already tried killing the app and starting it again."
JioSaavn,Jagriti Mishra,1,4,First of all.. there is no song available which i want.. if i get any song .. there is no jio tune available for that.. and if i get jio tune also.. its quality is so worst.. like it is in so cheap quality Songs from such movie MANN ... ANDAZZ... DIL HAI TUMAHARA... DULHAN HUM LE JAYENGE.. GENIUS.. are not available There is no song from above mentioned movie.. if u don't belive me.. go nd check your self..
JioSaavn,chirag patel,4,20,Nice response from Jiosaavan team. Finally Problem solved after uninstall savan application. Thank you.
JioSaavn,Sanchita Mohanty,3,18,"I don't know why I am not getting the code for confirmation of my Mobile no. I have been trying since 6 days from the date of installation of the app, still there is no response from the company. This type of service was not expected from a reputed company like yours."
JioSaavn,Atanu Mondal,4,27,"Good app for music lovers. It has almost all the songs. But it asks for payment when you want to download, for offline music. Without this issue it is good app."
JioSaavn,vineet chhajed,1,2,"after recieving notification to update jio music before 31 may, i have just updated it. after updating jio music as jiosaavan music, i didnt got my play list and many more other songs saved on jio music. instead of that i got so many other songs on this app. i am very much upset after updating. i want to get back my jio music back"
JioSaavn,kushal bansal,5,31,best music app ever. Translating feature(lyrics) is appreciable. But there is a requirement of a new in app look so as to make it fascinating
JioSaavn,ASHISH KAKRAN,4,19,"The app gives you one of the most versatile recommendations compared to any other app. sound quality is way too superior in pro version than any app,even better than global giant Spotify (of course you need to have good earphones to notice the difference). however, it lacks when you needed to share playlists or some song to other people... you can follow others but that requires Facebook access, perhaps internal sharing and following functions will do good."
JioSaavn,Rahmat Khan,1,29,"horrible app so much issues paying $5 a month to download, not been able to download songs and they have no idea wats going on with their own app. will definitely cancel subscription at the end of the month."
JioSaavn,Aaron Mathew,4,16,The app is really good! The selection of songs are huge and the quantity also great. The pro version is really cheap as well. But my one request is that you make the app a little bit smoother and also add the option to rearrange songs within a playlist.
JioSaavn,Taylor Swift,4,2,Look.... Everything is awesome but there are some songs which only pro user can play.... Whyyyyyy? We are also humans.... We also want to listen to them And biggest problem is.... Why there are no jio tunes ob Taylor Swift's songs.... I'm a big fan of her and no jio tune of her music..... Whyyyyyy?
JioSaavn,Pranav Karnik,1,11,"The song that I like isn't available to be set as caller tune, no matter from which album it belongs to. No reply from Jio. Pathetic."
JioSaavn,Shree Chakraborty,2,7,"Is there any particular day for Jio saavan not to set the Jio tune??? sometimes it just doesn't show the ""Make it your jiotune "" option to any song ! makes no sense to me! very much disappointed with it. otherwise the app is good.. please let me know if there is any rules like that.. I'm trying to change my jiotune but I can't.. bcoz there's no option in the list. that's why I'm giving 2 stars only. fix this problem so that I can give 5 stars.."
JioSaavn,Ravish Kumar,5,15,"Really love the app very much. It is the part of my life to listen songs on the app everyday. love the design, love the collections of music love the offline and on my phone expriences. wish to have able to use it through google assistant. All the wishes to remain India's no. 1 music app."
JioSaavn,Priyank Modi,4,20,"The app stops abruptly both when the screen is locked or unlocked (my device : Redmi 5). can't see any floating cards on the lock screen too. other than that, a grear collection. lyrics is a good addition but almost never properly synced. please fix"
JioSaavn,datta hakke,1,1,"worst app no select caller tune option. if this is strategy then we will have benefit to change operator by portability. I have ported from Airtel to jio but, now thinking to move Idea. worst experience and strategy by jio. trying to set Caller tune by SMS but giving wrong English songs as caller tones"
JioSaavn,Yash Uppal,1,5,"It's still not coming, I am on my cell phone data and I have clicked the (°°°) at the right of the song but still set as jio tune is not visible to me either."
JioSaavn,Asif Hussain,1,20,Some songs jio tune is not available. I can't set it so wrost app. I changed my network from idea to jio for caller tune.Now I just hate it this app.Make all songs available for jio ringtones. for changing network idea i have to wait for 80days..
JioSaavn,Sneha sharma,1,,"very poor customer support. my emails on ""inability to set jio tune"" haven't been answered yet. i had already logged out and again logged in my jio account twice but still i couldnt set my jio tunefor any song. also emailed this query to the support center but no reply very poor service."
JioSaavn,sujal p,1,14,just make sure that the main hit songs we can keep as caller tune most of the hit Once are not in your list that we can keep as caller tune mostly English. Rest the app is perfect 👌
JioSaavn,venky mojala,1,3,there is no option for offline. its just showing y9u need to get pro.. i hate that ..it is disgusting....and the ads are very embarrassing in middle of songs ... Don't you get ....&&its very very useless because of pro option and the ads people gets board to see ads .🥺😡🤬
JioSaavn,subhasis pati,4,1,Please make a voice recording part....so that I can use my voice recording as caller tune.... Please let me know about your decision on this......
JioSaavn,Akshay Dawar,1,3,Pathetic. after upgrading it to JioSaavn and after you have the pro version then also not able to download any song. Everytime it gets stuck in the loop. Old Saavn was way much better. will ne switching to other music apps for sure.
JioSaavn,sourav biswas,5,5,"this is a great music streaming app. but there is little problems too. it doesn't have enough english songs, specially of the rock legends the white stripes.. but great app. i love it so much. ☺️"
JioSaavn,Don Mirachi,4,1,the lyrics feature is a great addition but it's infrastructure is not good. if we forward the song and then bring it back the lyric highlighter will get stucked at the last line and if we change and then bring it back to the same song then the lyric highlighter will disappear completely.
JioSaavn,Ravi k Yuvan,4,,"Why search option is poorer?? When everythjng is amazing in this app, but the search engine alone sucks, resolve it and enable to provide results based on relevance and keyword. Work on Search Engine Optimization."
JioSaavn,Shouvik Roychoudhury,1,,Worst app. The funny thing is my review about this stupid app is being deleted by the team. I have paid an annual charge and I am feeling sorry for me. You guys dont even reply on gmail..
JioSaavn,AKSHAY Srivathsa Mamada,1,3,"Old one is Good.. i think it has huge bugs,(don't know exactly, whether it is happening only to me) in jiosaavn download speed is very slow, am trying in 25mbps died network ( jio internet speed and as well as wi-fi speed) ....!!!"
JioSaavn,Umang Pathak,1,,i cannot play all the offline songs in order it is without going for shuffle all. can someone help me on that? Thats why I'm giving 1 star. over all good app. but has a scope of betterment.
JioSaavn,Debraj Mondal,3,1,"As a JIO subscriber, why its not free with all features accessibility? Why it is always asking for PRO version? Are the JIO subscribers getting much accessibility of JioSaavn than other Non-JIO subscriber?"
JioSaavn,Rohit Shekhar,1,6,pathetic!!!worst experience...Please fix some bug....app crashing automatically...even my offine music which i had downloaded earlier is not showing in my music...ads after every song played...annoying!!...every time it ask me for pro subscription...and even can't login in this app...whenever i goes to my music section...it always show login page....😠😠😠
JioSaavn,Sona Choursiya,5,1,It's the best music app I have ever used. It's best part is is that it makes it easy to set different caller tunes. Thanks to JioSaavn for such a great service to the users 👍👍👍👍✌✌........Love this app....
JioSaavn,madhu tm,5,,My regular music app... Runs well even at low speed internet.. Have lot of songs collection. I cant cast the music in this app... except that everything else is fine. if you are using for free be prepared for annoying adds 😌
JioSaavn,Tejas 9,2,1,All is ok....but Make UI simpler...The one thing which makes competitors (ymusic and Spotify) outstanding is its UI.... PLEASE WORK ON THAT...
JioSaavn,anirudh badoni,1,13,"1.this app search bar sometimes doesn't work ,sometimes it search a song but most of the time it dosent. 2. it does not play music in my car nither with aux nor with bluetooth. the audio quality is so awful when played in car."
JioSaavn,Soumyajit Das,1,3,"Way too much advertisements, like seriously after every song, 30sec commercial. Atleast give a commercial after 4-5 songs. Also songs collection is not that great & suggestions are never accurate. Pathetic, uninstalling right away!!"
JioSaavn,shubham prajapaati,5,5,It has been a wonderful experience using Saavan. I like its new feature of displaying lyrics along with the song. I really love this app. I would recommend one to use this app.
JioSaavn,ISHAN SUKHANI,1,,"i don't get what is wrong with this app. it gets fixed once and then 10 new problems pop up. I'm so very disappointed, after 2 years of membership I'm officially switching"
JioSaavn,Imtiaz Uddin,3,20,The Saavn user interface always has been revolutionary but the new look is a delight. But now there are so many more apps available in the market. The Lyrics UX is bad. JioSaavn is very behind from its competition.
JioSaavn,Jaswinder Chhabra,2,,Even latest Trending Popular Punjabi Songs not available.if by chance anyone available ie not available to set for Caller Tune (Jio Tune).Many More Good Music app like Ganaa available which are much better then this app like they provide video streaming also inside the app.
JioSaavn,Girijasivam Girijasivam,5,,Very good. But one thing must improve. Place correct movies and songs. Otherwise superb. I love it. That too jio tunes liked sooooo much. Pls. My favorite song mukuntha mukuntha make this jio ring tones. Movie name dhasavadharam
JioSaavn,seshagiri vemuri,1,9,Worst app after the latest update. The app should be atleast free for the jio users but it was not plus a lot of ads and a very clumsy interface. The old jio music was a bit lag but it works flawlessly its the best. This jiosaavn is the worst app
JioSaavn,Yash Mehta,1,6,"Worst experience after switching over to JioSaavn from Saavn. Most of the times, the songs just doesn't load even if internet connection is working perfectly fine. Do something for it ASAP !"
JioSaavn,AMIT CHOUDHARY,1,,old version was much better then this... actully jio music was much much better and simple then this version or jiosaavn... plzzz give permission to go to the last version any how... only adds are coming to join pro in saavn... NO OPTION OF SET JIO TUNE in the latest version...
JioSaavn,Sangeeta Pandey,3,2,Everything is good but why I can't access my downloads as it allowed in its old version (Jio Music)?And kindly do something so that I can set my device music to my jio caller tune plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....... Lyrics are missing 😔 little bit disappointed
JioSaavn,Shreeyash Deshpande,1,1,Voice ads suck big time. That also while changing tracks. I can tolerate visual ads. But these voice ads will definitely be your downfall.
JioSaavn,Saravanan Hari,1,,Even we are good without lyrics. Please don't spoil the language. Post the lyrics only after verification. Not just for the sake or fame. Very disappointed.
JioSaavn,Sejal Gupta,1,,i am unable to search any song here ...how is this possible??..If search wont process..how we can find our favourite songs?? Just not a good experience with the updated one!
JioSaavn,Paul W,1,3,"Stop asking me for location permission every time I launch the app. Even after I deny the permission, it asks for the same permission next time I launch it. It is like you are forcing me to give you my location info. It is my decision. I won't give my location for apps which I think don't need location. I don't want you to curate music or recommendations for me. I can find the music I want. That's why Search option is for."
JioSaavn,Rudra Gautam.,1,4,"Dear devloper, i guess you had gone through every possible way to make it best, but could you make it simple as hell, i couldnot find my songs added on favourite list, nither there is any option. Also there is no help button to asy you guys for help. I had played 13 songs today at 1-2 am and now its not in my History. Where the hell could i find ittttttt ?????????????? goole need to add no rating option too so we could give you zero. ahhh waste of time."
JioSaavn,Kaustav Halder,2,1,"I have no problem with the app and the varieties of music BUT why are the advertisements so LOUD and INTRUSIVE. I understand that I may opt for pro version to get rid of ads BUT why they have to deliberately DISTURB my mood! The ads should be of same volume as I'm playing my music. PLEASE fix this, and change my view on Saavn OTHERWISE there are many ALTERNATIVES I can opt for."
JioSaavn,Hironmoy Goswami,1,,"too many ads this days ... firstly it works smoothly but ....when it,was update to jio saavn after one song ads use to come .... fix this problem soon ....and it also shown us to update to the paid version for no ads.... this should not done"
JioSaavn,Yogendra Singh Mahadule,1,1,"many songs show Jio tune unavailable like songs of Genious movie , Heyy babyy, Khaab by Akhil and many more songs. If this will not be fixed i will change my network from Jio to Airtel. 🤬🤬🤬🤬"
JioSaavn,Rajib Sarkar,3,7,"I'm a regular user of Saavn and I upgraded Saavn for better music. but why it is so difficult to find the original songs of a singer or movie. for example i searched for the artist Adele and when i opened her gallery i didn't at least found a single original song of her.all songs of her are either mix version or from award function. why not original track?????????? and another one,i searched for the Hrithik Roshan's Jodhaa Akbar movie's songs but saavn doesn't have any songs from this movie????"
JioSaavn,Dhinesh kanna,5,7,"wow ! the option ""Super duper"" (320 kbps) is really awesome. and the equalizer is really good. i like this app very much"
JioSaavn,itz_me_ chandru,5,1,This app is just awesome there is no negatives but I have a suggestion give registration for some songs for which there is no jio tunes which will improve later and show notification when it is available I hope you'll take my suggestion thank you jio🤗🤗🤗
JioSaavn,Prachi Patil,1,,After update all my downloaded songs gone.. and when trying to download it again nothing happening.. I was pro user still 3 months pending so all my money is wasted because it became JioSaavn. I even tried uninstalling and logging in again all waste
JioSaavn,A Google user,4,3,"Using it for a year. Good experience overall, support from JioSaavn is pretty good. But English music collection is not that good enough as Hindi in my opinion."
JioSaavn,Shindlay Nath,2,,"The app is lacking in international language selection and also most importantly there should be a option to show or to hide the Explicit content, the user is not having any control on the explicit content they are show while in radio."
JioSaavn,ManI X,4,1,"one issue found : on android pie device - Search option is very poor in terms of finding artist, movies , album . fetching results are not proper also. fix it . ( at least for paid users)"
JioSaavn,Ayush Raikwar,1,3,worst app. too many bugs. too many ads. app forces the ads. there is no option for jiotunes selection. i hate this app.
JioSaavn,Susmit Mukherjee,4,11,"All seems okay with the application, I feel that one thing should be added into this app, that is, to have a sorting order in the download section, where i can sort the downloaded songs as ""recently added"". So that i can found all the downloaded songs in recently added songs manner."
JioSaavn,Raj The Great,5,,"JioSaavn is the best way to listen to all your music, anytime, Unlimited songs across Bollywood, English, Hindi, and Indian regional languages like Tamil, Punjabi, and others. It really helped me to improve my health by making me more active and enthusiastic..I really loved this app very veryy🤑🤑🤑 much now I can run 5km daily without any problem😇😇😇 Very Very thank U JIO and SAVAN for coming together and making dis aweaome app. Bt now I have completed all my 500 hundred words quata 😍😍😍"
JioSaavn,Divyanshu Ranjan Srivastava,1,,"They have reduced the number of jio tunes. Earlier almost all the hindi songs were available for jiotune option but now even those have been removed. Add english and hindi songs for jiotunes, atleast consider famous ones."
JioSaavn,Avi Kish,2,47,This app crashes after downloading 500 songs. instead of showing all the songs only 50-60 is displayed in the songs.
JioSaavn,Ravi Shankar,2,1,two bugs that bug me are music stops after sometime when screen goes off and starts when i turn on the screen and there is no music controller in the notification bar. to change the music you need to go to the app everytime.
JioSaavn,sai bharadwaj,5,8,excellent but it is very convenient if we have chance to set jiotune to particular contact those who has more jio sims as iam facing this issue that iam unable to set jiotune to one number from which I have logged in it is going to set to another number that iam unable change

JioSaavn,DNYANESHWAR PATIL,1,4,worst experience with this app all though new lyrics option is good but so many spelling mistakes in lyrics and half of lyrics are written in hindi or any different language and so many ads after every music I'll recommend to use ganna app or wynk music is better than this app jio saavan i think is worst app don't download it.
JioSaavn,Faizan Shaik,2,,jio music was so good with no ads and was not with any membership... jio saavn is also good but there are ads and we don't want any membership .. so please make it like before as jio music or make it ad free without any membership ..

JioSaavn,Sudhanshu Mishra,3,6,"Some popular songs are missing & support people don't listen to you despite multiple mails. Also, getting an add after every song is really frustrating. Other than that, the app is good for listening songs online."
JioSaavn,Anjali Vaze,2,9,Since last couple of days I am trying to download songs but unable to do so. i try downloading but it shows that I have downloaded but actually it doesn't even show on my offline downloads. Please help.

JioSaavn,RISHAV KUMAR,1,3,What rubbish you are doing Jio. First you turn your Jio music into Jio Saavan and then after few months now Jio Saavan is demanding monthly subscription Fee to download a song. Its not good.. Our Jio Music was better than it.. Come back again with Jio Music.
JioSaavn,Aryan Singh Rajput,3,2,"Great, but it would have been excellent if a real download option would be available for the users from where we can access songs through our phone's folder and can transfer the songs in SD cards."
JioSaavn,Vineet Mehta,5,5,i think that's the best way to learn or hear music ....i feel very gorgeous..it also shows the latset music at the present time..very good well done...i m impressed.. appreciate ur app..🤘👌👌👌

JioSaavn,Ravjot Singh Oberoi,2,1,I am a premium customer but i I have to download some songs on jio Saavn but I don't .because when I put some song download it will take that it means it was download Di but it was not downloading please fix the bugs
JioSaavn,kanchan nautiyal,1,5,i had rated it with 4 star earlier becoz it was good at that time .. bht now they are showing too many of unnecesaary adds..and why the hell we need to take monthly subscription to remove ad they are your ad. and with ad you can't even download songs now just take monthly subscription. which is very expensive.Jio has turned a good app into worst.
JioSaavn,gsrs chaitanya,3,2,"nice app but not showing on screen lock , everytime i have to unlock my phone to change a song and i have checked all my setting and there is nothing wrong with them. please rectify the issue it is so annoying"
JioSaavn,Nabnit Kumar Mishra,2,7,When asking Google Assistant to play a song via JioSaavn Google says JioSaavn isn't installed on your device even of it is actually installed. Google gives the Play Store link to download JioSaavn which actually opens up to Saavn (Old app) page on Play Store.
JioSaavn,Dhruv singh,4,,It's the best app to listen song and I will prefer every one to here song from here audio quality is very good and I think all of the song are available on it it is a lighter version of savan it take very less space and I m very happy with this app

JioSaavn,Bhupendra Singh Kothari,3,3,1. This app isn't compatible with android auto. don't know why but the previous one which was only saavn insteed of jio saavn was compatible with android auto and this one isn't. 2. Didn't mukesh ambani promised that all the jio services will be available at no extra cost?? but now they are asking money for a ad free experiance.
JioSaavn,J Kang,5,,"Great app, free version would be sufficient for most users. Great selection of playlists. Paid for version only seems to gain more personalisation."
JioSaavn,Amulyakumar pati,5,1,"Awsome app**"" sometimes it working or somtime not. Many times songs are played but the music has stopped.. Is there any reasons.. My network was good at that times.. Please correct the issue.."
JioSaavn,ZETRON machine,1,,says there is a english option on the website but there isn't. The website says it has certain music but forces you to download the app and ends up not being any music. Soundcloud 10/10 Spotify 9/10 Pandora 4/10 JioSaavn 0/10
JioSaavn,Nikhil Singh,5,3,I loved jiosaavn app.it is a great app i just want a favour please add synced lyrics then this app will be all-rounder. please reply.♥️😄 Thankyou !!! ♥️ for adding lyrics in new update.😭😃 I love you.😭(Bhot sahi hai yeh.)
JioSaavn,Nandha Kumar,5,5,"Edit: After update, it's working as expected. Thanks team 🙃. Unable to download songs in Motorola one power/Android pie for pro account."
JioSaavn,vidyasagar gurudev,5,2,This is a very easy app to set a caller tune. You can use it in any ways. So downloaded and also share it.
JioSaavn,Aakila Rajan,1,2,"the song collection is good. but i bought saavn pro and downloaded all the songs on one of my devices.....and tried syncing it with another device ....but it shows ""unavailable"" for all the songs. dont know why it would work perfectly on one Device ans not on the other"
JioSaavn,Rajat Das,2,,too much adds..and I don't know what is the necessity of pro version..it was simple jio music..we were happy with it..old version was far better.. otherwise it's a good app
JioSaavn,Sitam Kumar,2,,Would've rated 5⭐ if it was of free of cost or price less than 💯. What's the benefit of being a PRIME member !!?
JioSaavn,Y A S H J A I N,1,,"since 27.05.2019 'radio' in jiosaavn has stopped working, songs can be played from playlists and albums but radio is the best part which has stopped working. please fix it soon"
JioSaavn,Tenzin Kalsang,5,3,best app by the best institute in india. i was sad at first to know we have to pay but i always Belief its time to give back a little. love you jio and mukesh ambani(my first ever review)
JioSaavn,Brajeshwari Devi,3,1,I have waited for a long time for the Song #fakira from movie STOY 2 to set it as my caller tune but there has been no option till now for it; and there are many of the songs like these which do not have any options of setting those as caller tune... now at this point I'm unsatisfied with this app...
JioSaavn,amitava basu,1,,Now Jio showing it's actual colour. After updating you can't play offline mode. Now it's a paid version provided by jio. It's really disgusting. Uninstalling...
JioSaavn,ukesh___ A.R.R,4,,"This app has given me tough time to spend alone! It has got enormous songs, way out of choices. Really love this & strongly recommend for the usage!!!"
JioSaavn,Neeru Sen Roy,5,3,Very nice app. Very easy to use and great albums. Also it has all the songs! Really enjoying it.
JioSaavn,laziz dawat,1,,"i wanted to give zero star but such option is not there , my reaction is so bcoz im nt able to put naat as my caller tune...why such problem is there only with naats . developer should see on this seriously"
JioSaavn,Purbasa Paul,3,1,"please ,make the caller tunes available for some english songs .. for eg , Shawn Mendes songs , Niall Horan songs , Ed sheeran songs ..... none of the jio tunes are available"
JioSaavn,rahul singh,2,,"there was a pretty good music app, called jio music, then the ads came,, and turned it into a money grabbing music app, like others,, now its not good any more"
JioSaavn,Vishnu T Murali,1,300,"please remove the 'Set as caller tune' option, why are you guys showing these bunch of texts? just to fill up the canvas huh? there is no use other than that. I'm not able to set not even a single song as caller tune. You know, if you are providing a feature, it should be available otherwise what is the use? So, please remove this option or please make it available. This is just one drawback I mentioned, that doesn't mean this app is perfect except this feature. I'm running out of charecters."
JioSaavn,Prapti Garg,4,4,Lyrics of many songs are missing. I love JioSaavn but the only reason that I won't be paying for Pro again is that even after you take the pro subscription you can't store songs in external storage. Cause interal storage gets filled up. I love the new update with lyrics 😍😍😍😍
JioSaavn,Subrahmanya Bhat,2,322,"Wanted to give you guys feedback on how JioSaavn works on Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. When a song is being played, it doesn't show up in notification centre at all. To change a song or to play or pause it I need to open the app every single time. Pls fix this issue of you can. If this is not an issue from your end I may have to write to Samsung about this. Please let me know."
JioSaavn,Amrita Mishra,1,34,cheaper app..😠 its not working properly...songs which m searching is not showing and not set that song for jio tunes ..😕 Worst app..
JioSaavn,Introvert 21,3,,some songs are not available to set as jio tune for which I'm unsatisfied. adds keeps popping up which is another minus point. or else the music is fine not bad.
JioSaavn,sivakumar bunny,4,,thanks for fixing the problem one thing need to tell please add all listened songs as que and change them at any time from top to bottom at any place any serious please do this. thank you for fixing..
JioSaavn,KunRides,1,1,"Jeeta tha jiske liye & Tum dil ki dhadkan mein gaane ko Jio tune nahi bana sakte hain.... Please support those two songs! please respond! or atleast let know why I can't use those songs... valid reasons! please, team Jio! BAADSHAH OH BAADSHAH song's jio tune is needed! please 🤗"
JioSaavn,Aditya Soman,4,1,"The app works really fine except for a few instances when it crashes on my Redmi Note 4 and I have to start all over again. Also, few movies/albums are hard to find on the app even inspite of searching the same. Kindly look for this issues, otherwise the app is just awesome"
JioSaavn,Prabhaker Yasa,4,496,"The quality of music is among the best due to the 320 kbps streaming. The issue I have is how the app behaves on losing Bluetooth or AUX connectivity. You would expect the app to pause playing till connectivity is restored. However, it will continue to play through the phone speaker, unlike most other apps. This behavior can cause some nuisance in public places or quiet places."
JioSaavn,Sunny Choudhary,4,328,"Optimization is very much needed. I can experience a lot of bugs while using the app. For example, app closes automatically once all the downloads are complete. This started happening from last update I think. Still iOS app is way better in performance as compared to android one. Other then this, I like using jioSaavn. It feels my own. Good work."
JioSaavn,Madhava rao Maturi,1,1,"if there is available negitive review i want to give that Because in Other Mysic apps we can Download Songs and can listen in when offline But here we cant download songs like free,We have to purchase jio saavan offline pack..Just hate this App..😠😠😠"
JioSaavn,Rajeev Metta,5,84,"I absolutely love this app and use it atleast 3-4 hours everyday. I have a pro version and satisfied with the collection of songs and the quality of it. Even not well known indie songs are available too ! The layout is good, seaching for songs is a breeze. However it still has to work on song recommendations. The app throws up a few issues occasionally such as download not starting or a downloaded song taking a while to start playing but I feel it's minor and not worth fretting about it."
JioSaavn,Aurobindo Sardar,4,4,Well a little bit good and a little bit bad. The bad parts are - save songs to SD Card option is not available and finally the odia songs espicially didn't have the perfect album cover and album name. Those things are awaited.
JioSaavn,laxmi nayak,4,,"Easy to operate.. but, sometimes the ""play next"" option does not work properly. That's the only bad thing of this app."
JioSaavn,Ravi Singh,4,15,the download features is creating problem. the songs do not get downloaded neither in mobile network nor on wifi. developers please look into the matter all else is working fine .. the new lyrics features is so good 😊😊
JioSaavn,Shubham Naik,1,1,used to be very good app earlier but now the ads are started to come. wrist thing is Jio network is so slow that even ads are buffering. after every two songs long advertisement will come which is very irritating. I know other apps also had got ads but not as much as JioSaavn.
Spotify,Heather Hammond,1,2344,"I use to LOVE Spotify. Paid for premium for years and use it daily. but for the last month now without missing a day, it will just stop playing mid song. its not being used elsewhere, I'm not using my phone and it is random as to when it will do it during my listening session. could be 2 songs in or 6 songs in or do it every single song in a row. doesnt matter if the playlist is saved to my phone, through my google home, in my car or on the web version on my laptop. it's beyond frustrating."
Spotify,Will Ducklow,1,1499,"I hate this design change. You've inexplicably gone back to the 'starred songs' model that you abandoned years ago. If I ""like"" a song now it no longer shows under artists or albums, so the only way to find it is in the ""liked songs"" playlist? There's no longer any way to have all the music I've ""liked"" as well as the songs from the albums I've saved in the same playlist unless I go back and like every single one of those songs. You've introduced a huge pain point for long-time users. Thanks!"
Spotify,A. S.,1,934,"I have been a Spotify Premium user for years. The most recent update ruined the way I use Spotify. I either scroll through my list of artist to select music or I shuffle all my songs. There is no way to view your library anymore. You can view artists you follow, but I don't follow any artists, not even ones I regularly listen to. There is no list of artists. There is no list of songs. I have no way to view the music I have accumulated over the years. In essence, my library has been erased"
Spotify,Heaven Metzger,1,1799,"Unless my phone is unlocked the music stops which is really frustrating since I use it when I'm going to bed, at work, and driving since I prefer it over the radio. Also I can't skip songs from my lock screen anymore. I keep the app updated but that doesn't seem to help. If this doesn't get fixed I'm finding a different app!! It's ridiculous! I shouldn't have to drain my phone battery by leaving it on and unlocked to listen to music and the lock screen controls should work!!"
Spotify,Kyle Vasconcellos,1,569,"The new UI is terrible. Removed the all songs tab. You have to specifically ""follow"" artists for them to get put in to your library and sorted in alphabetical order. Otherwise they're just shown as ""recommended artists"" in random order. You can no longer easily save partial albums. The only way to get an album to show up in your library is to hit save which adds the whole thing. This is a complete step backwards and likely to cause people to switch services. What the hell, Spotify"
Spotify,amy bauer,1,479,"this app was at one point amazing. it hasnt worked for the past couple weeks. it logs me out, doesn't recognize my password, keeps connecting to waze. ive uninstalled and tried to reinstall multiple times, each time having to redownload thousands of songs. i pay for premium and can't use the app. they really need to fix whatever they did. it sucks."
Spotify,Mark Hibbard,2,302,"I love the selection of music, but i have constant problems with this app. For instance, i have Spotify Premium, yet every time i try to download music, it tells me i ""discovered a premium feature!"" and wont let me download. Unlike Amazon, there is a storage limit. Time to time it wont let me listen offline. I never have issues like this with Amazon."
Spotify,Sina Hadilou,5,8301,"I'm realy enjoying using this app. I literally can find any song I want. It's just AMAZING! I stay up-to-date about latest releases, I can keep track of viral songs in different countries and most importantly I can access to the BEST PLAYLISTS EVER made by Spotify Community. If you're thinkin' on installing it, well... don't hesitate cause you're about to dive into millions of songs with highest quality. I hope you'll enjoy it too like I've been for 4 years."
Spotify,Alistair Crowlace,5,572,"I love this app. My #1 music choice. I would rate 5 stars if I could at least skip songs. Pause them. Rewind a song without having to get back onto the app. Another thing, It will play a song for two seconds then stop then play for a second then stop then start again. I thought it was my WiFi at first so I turned it off and then played a downloaded song and it was still having the same problem. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars."
Spotify,Tyler Sands,1,728,"For the last three months or so Spitify has been terrible. It randomly stops playing in the middle of songs. Lately I can't even get through a single song without an interruption, these are downloaded offline songs, fyi. I've lost the ability to change songs from a bluetooth device, such as my car, or my soundbar at home, unless the screen of my phone is on and Spotify is the app being displayed. I use to love Spotify, this app is garbage now. I want my $30 back for the last few months."
Spotify,Anthony Byrne,1,132,"Since the new updates, Spotify has gone to s***. If you save a few songs from an artist, the only way you can see/play these songs is by making a playlist or searching through all your saved songs. What moron decided it would a good idea to make it more difficult for users to find the music they have liked, so counter intuitive. FIX THIS NOW OR ME AND MANY MORE PPL WILL GO TO YOUR COMPETITORS!!!"
Spotify,eli martinez,5,1041,"I never had any subscriptions to streaming services but I gotta say... spotify is definitely worth it. It's pretty great to be able to find every song you want to hear and listen to them without any ads interrupting you. whether going to the gym, hanging with your significant other or just chilling or cruising, it's great. Let me not forget to mention the ability to discover new artists... I love it."
Spotify,Chris Quintero,2,559,"Randomly stops for no reason.. It's so annoying to have to go back in to the app and have it reload. Almost every time, I've had to start a song over halfway through because the app randomly stops. I've stopped listening to podcasts for this reason. Idk what happened but it wasn't like this before. It's been months. Sometimes I just drive in silence rather than restart the app. It was so good before this issue."
Spotify,Keith Shigeta,5,190,"i really like Spotify, i have built a library of almost all my cd's and then some. love to be able to create playlists. and the ""auto play feature"" plays similar music to what i was listening to. i have found some really great music from that feature. and i check my artists albums & many times a new album comes up. love it listen at least 1/2 day, everyday. thanks Spotify... great stuff!!!"
Spotify,Josh M,5,904,"amazing music app, way better than Pandora that's for sure. Downloading music really helps with working so I don't destroy my data. Premium is really worth it for all the features you get. interface is simple to understand but still allows for stuff like playlists or even queues. in the future I would like it if you could swap around themes of the interface so you maybe change it up once in a while."
Spotify,Simon Derbyshire,2,9,"I love Spotify. I use it for all my music needs but since the update in May 19, if my phone screen turns off, after a few seconds the music pauses and can take 30 seconds or so to un-pause and then pauses again. I have the songs downloaded to my phone so this isn't a buffering issue and it also happens when I have my headphones connected. This is highly frustrating and I hope you fix the issue soon. new update on 29 May 19 hasn't fixed the problem with my S10+"
Spotify,V Louis,2,135,"The daily mix all of a sudden doesn't allow you to rewind. I often use Spotify while I'm driving and the fact that I now have to unlock the phone to replay a song that I really like is dangerous and unsafe. At first I thought my steering wheel controls weren't working in my car, but I realized that they work only while listening to play lists that I've created. Fix it!"
Spotify,Jacqueline Bennett,1,186,"Experiencing major issues with Spotify since last night. The app keeps crashing and becoming unresponsive. I can't change songs and when I close the app music continues playing, then I get a notification telling me the app has stopped responding. I updated the app the this morning but still facing the same issue. Please advise when this will be fixed ASAP as I'm currently paying for a service that isn't working as expected."
Spotify,Aaron Harrison,1,274,"Worse with each update. Constant loading screens, unintuitive UI, songs pausing and breaking up randomly. Even downloaded music hardly works. Terrible compared to how it was a year ago. Spotify, if it's a Samsung issue, at least let us know so we can point the pitchforks elsewhere. Your update notes are non existent, as are your responses. I can't tell what's worse, your lack of transparency or your app. Try putting the same effort into the fix as you do into obviously fake 5* reviews."
Spotify,Teilor Ann,1,2948,"when Spotify updated the library to a playlist style they lost all functionality of a regular music library. no filtering by artist or really any kind of useful filtering. if I want to filter I have to create a new playlist or add songs to queue individually. the organization is terrible. unfortunately, the user interface is now incredibly difficult to use and Spotify is no longer as enjoyable or useful as before this useless update. Also glitchy. May be time to find a new streaming service."
Spotify,Marie,1,230,"I loved spotify until this recent update. You cannot listen to music unless the phone is unlocked. Everytime the lock screen pops on the app stops. It even does it in the car while connected to bluetooth. It looks like I'm deleting this app and deactivating my account. I guess it's time to familiarize myself with Tidal or Pandora because this isn't working. Smh, just awful."
Spotify,Robin Noya,1,129,The advertisements are too loud. I'll be listening to a song at a normal volume and then suddenly an advertisement comes on and they literally hurt my ears that I have to take my earphones off. It's happened several times now. I'm trying this new app to broaden my music listening options but this alone makes me want to go back to Pandora. You should fix this. Review revised 5/13/19 2:21pm DIRECT ENERGY ADVERTISEMENT I was listening to a soft song (cashmere and ariana) and the moment it ended I
Spotify,Kirsty Stewart,1,146,"I used to use spotify on a daily basis but ever since they updated the library feature to just 'followed artists' and 'albums' I rarely use it. It was amazing before, if I only liked one song from an artist it was downloaded, but now I have to search through my liked songs, all 1687, just to find one song. Please bring back the previous library function. The app is barely worth using now"
Spotify,Nicholas Kalamoudacos,1,83,"Why can't there also just be a library where EVERY song I download is saved not just the ones I've liked because if I download an album or playlist, it's too much of a mission to go and like every single song in said album/playlist. Just this one library where I can find EVERYTHING. Like an ""all songs"" kinda thing? so then I can put that on shuffle and listen to ALL MY SONGS . Just a thought otherwise nothing wrong with Spotify Premium, but please, ADD IT! Also, some songs I like don't get added"
Spotify,Dan Thompson,1,3,"When I was using the service and didn't have a paid account, I reported what I thought to be deceiving actions on part of how spotify operates. I was given the reply in form of a snide comment, offended, and basically told to take a hike. Disrespectful and childish, and that's why I rate you at one star. Work on your customer service for the next person if you want but the damage is already done by spotify IMHO as a hollow apology based on monetary tangent won't suffice."
Spotify,Jayson Brown,1,95,"It was a good app until they decided to ruin it by removing the artists, songs, and albums in the My Music tab and replace it with Liked Songs where all 1600 of my songs are thrown in there together. It doesn't help that spotify it very difficult to contact just to tell them this, but I'm considering switching apps because of how horrible this update is. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. please bring back the older version"
Spotify,Bill Kosic,1,37,"It was great until I upgraded to premium, now the song title does not appear on my car audio unit and I can only skip one song which gets very frustrating . Deezer and You Tube Music are working via Bluetooth in my car, song titles are displayed, can skip as many songs as I want, why doesn't Spotify work? With absolutely no help from the Spotify team, I figured it out. Spotify is having a brain fart with Android Auto. No other apps are, just Spotify. Now it's randomly stopping mid song☹️"
Spotify,Caryn Morgan,1,3,"spotify keeps adding weird, unrelated songs to my playlists, as well as playing unrelated songs on other playlists I listen to. I tried deleting the ""suggested"" songs, but more were automatically added. worse, I couldn't stop playing the added songs that I _deleted_ because I used all my skips, so I was stuck with either silence or ""All Star in a minor key"" while driving. I chose silence. not sure this is a service I'd pay for, if the app automatically adds music I'm not interested in."
Spotify,CRAIG SMITH,2,4,"keeps cutting out when phone is locked listening through bluetooth, I'm not the only one as it seems others are having the same issue. please get it sorted as it's not enjoyable listening to music. why don't you state what the update includes that way a least we would know what has changed or if you have solved issues."
Spotify,Lee Chapman,1,168,"Terrible, what on earth has happened to your app, I click on a song (even ones I've downloaded) takes 30 seconds to even start, massive lag, and crashes all the time. I'm using a galaxy s10 plus on 100mbps WiFi and 4g. I've uninsralled app and reinstalled, updated to latest version etc. Sort it out Spotify, I don't pay £10 a month for this."
Spotify,Omz Cana,1,113,What happened? I can't play my downloaded songs. All my playlists wont autoplay after the first song. The song thumbnail isn't showing as well. Some songs stop after 2 seconds and go to a diffetent song and does the same. Spotify has become a mess. Please fix this. I didn't go premium for this.
Spotify,Daft PunkSkittle,4,828,"Edit: as of 5/21 they fixed this issue below 4/20 a month ago. Update 4/20 makes the songs stop and play in 2 second intervals thru every song to the point that it hurts your ears. When you pay for this app 16 dollars a month I expect it to not give me ear damage and actually work, Plus spotify phone screen functionality has stop working completely. You cant rewind,cant skip,cant pause or play a song without unlocking your phone going to the app and doing the pausing, rewinding or skipping there"
Spotify,Bob M,3,298,I generally like Spotify and think it's one of the best music services available but it has some odd behaviors and missing features that keep it from being great. Wish for more social media features to discuss and review/rate and discover music. Perplexed why it defaults to shuffle when I want to play an album. Albums are meant typically to be played in their designated track sequence. Some odd interactions between Google home assistant and Spotify regarding favoriting versus adding tracks
Spotify,Akshat Rastogi,1,51,"So many of the songs are missing from its library its downright disappointing. that's just unacceptable to say the least, so many other apps are offering all the songs example YouTube music. YouTube music is an amazing app. Should've gone for trial verison of spotify before buying for the entire year. guys please be careful missing songs are a big letdown. also complained to them about missing songs and received a very generic reply over Twitter. not acceptable."
Spotify,xoxo Deb,3,8,"I'm not sure what the problem is, if it's the chromecast or something, but anytime I connect to spotify on my phone and tablet, my t.v blacks out and stops working. I know its spotify because I have tried opening multiple times, and my t.v does the same thing over and over again. I've tried closing other apps, restarting my device, it does the same thing, and it's getting annoying. also, the ads are getting ridiculous. used to be my most used app and now it's not."
Spotify,Subha Padmanaban,3,2,"Awesome music and podcast app! There are personalized playlists and has a wonderful UI. Been using it since its India launch. Having been a great fan for the last couple of years, I was eagerly awaiting its launch. It didn't completely fulfill my expectations, though some changes were made. 2 cons, Indian new songs need to be quickly updated and the issue with Warner music makes a large number of songs unavailable to be played in India. Even then, this has been my favourite music app of choice."
Spotify,Jessica Wright,4,223,"I love Spotify. It's the only app I use for music on my phone and especially to listen to music in the car. However, I've had persistent issues with the music stopping on its own while I'm driving. I've opened a support ticket, so I am hopeful this will be resolved soon."
Spotify,Rachel Beck,1,17,"Origin review in April: Since I've updated the app has been buggy and my music keeps ending in the middle of songs and podcasts. Update: a month and a half later and the issue seems worse. If it continues I will cancel my subscription because what's the point of paying if I can't get through a song or podcast? This is happening when I stream on wifi, data, etc. Or play downloaded music and when my phone is set to offline and online. I've run out of control factors to minimize the effect."
Spotify,JustYo AverageJo,5,10,"What Artists don't you have? I'll admit there's a few songs I can't find out of my vast list of Artists I've searched up, but every single Artist and then some I've managed to at least find. Pandora used to be good, but unfortunately they tend to play songs that aren't by the Artist that I want to listen to, and instead make it search up other Artists like them, and I'm forced to listen to some I've never heard and in most cases don't like. Spotify? Nah. They let me MAKE my own list of songs."
Spotify,Phoenyx Jones,1,76,"Since the recent updates the app has been constantly crashing while I'm on my phone doing other things. And when I'm not on my phone, music will randomly stop playing until I wake up my screen. If im going to pay for this app, all i ask is that it actually works."
Spotify,Claudia GONZÁLEZ LARENAS,2,6,"so i've been using Spotify for Free on my laptop and on laptop you can click on a song and the whole song will play (unless you pause it or switch it of course) even if you don't have premium. however when i got a phone, i downloaded the app and discovered that, unless you pay, you just have to keep shuffling until you get the song you want. and you can only skip 6 songs an hour. i can't pay for premium because i'm only 13 with no job. the song will also stop for a few seconds for no real reason."
Spotify,Ryan Schauer,2,10,"For 2019, this app is really terrible. if this were a first rev app from 2010 I would understand, but it's like Spotify developers don't actually listen to music. I highly recommend the devs go buy themselves a zune hd, install the software and use it for a month to see what good interface design looks like. This app could be amazing. Instead, it's the app I have to use until I can find a better one."
Spotify,Anand S,3,2,"This is a nice app but I am having an issue with it. For other music apps, the remote button on the headphone works as play-pause, skip track or go to previous track with single click, double click and triple click respectively. But on spotify the triple click function doesn't work. The only way is to take out your phone from your pocket and go to the previous track if needed. This feature however works fine on the iOS version of the app. Hope you guys fix this ASAP."
Spotify,Fmease,1,1,"Premium user here. This app has become so unbeliebably slow: Slow startup, online searching, loading an album, the latter even in offline mode! Why does it take so much time? And why can't I find my 'saved' albums and artists anymore? The new system is so confusing: There are 'liked' songs and they are supposted to be the new 'saved' ones? But then, why can't a 'like' an album? I am a faithful premium Spotify user, please do not let me suffer!"
Spotify,0ffBrand G.O.A.T,2,4,"This app is horrible. Lately it has been constantly been shoving songs I never added down my throat along with their self promotion adds that sometimes wont go away, forcing you to re-open the app. You have to listen to up to 6 adds before you can start listening to music again, music that you never wanted to listen to. This leads to my next point. Spotify adds too many songs to your playlist without explanation and this causes you to waste your skips on these songs. It is ridiculous."
Spotify,Kekoa Vierra,1,8,the songs that I liked and want to hear again does not work!!!! It says playing suggested songs but it's not even the songs I want!!!! this is pissing me off!!! Give ppl that dont have premium the ability to Thumbs down the stupid songs that arent part of our liked songs!!!!
Spotify,Dannii Faulks,1,,"Great place to listen to music but why the hell would you add random tracks to the playlist I created, if I wanted them there I would have added them but I did NOT, they were not even relevent. You should have had a pop up or something to say ""Would you like us to add some other tracks we like you will also like?"" yes or no then as an option. This would have been better"
Spotify,Stacy Williams,1,1,"I've been using Spotify for 10 years, but having nothing but trouble for the past 6 months. I've been paying for premium so I can walk/run for an hour or 2. and listen the whole time w/ no stops or pauses. Now Spotify pauses as soon as my phone goes into sleep mode. no other music app does this!!!! I shouldn't have to ""troubleshoot"" on my phone when it's obvs a Spotify problem!! Fix this!!!!!"
Spotify,Catherine Stauffer,1,60,"Samsung S10 : been using spotify since before it was an app. the latest update, as everyone else has mentioned, randomly stops the songs and I can't play them from the screen I have to go into the app and skip to the next song. also, it's been terrible at syncing with the computer desktop app (eg the queue won't update). I originally thought it was a headphone/internet thing, but apparently it's been happening to loads of people. will update review when these bugs are fixed."
Spotify,A Google user,1,64,"First of all, you can't scroll back in the song. Secondly, I have to use shuffle play on my playlists. Thirdly, you are limited on the amount of skips. Fourthly, SPOTIFY ADDS SONG TO YOUR PLAYLIST WHEN YOU DONT WANT THEM THERE! And its not like you can remove those songs. If I were you, I wouldn't unless you're willing to pay for premium."
Spotify,Allie Austin,1,6,"Like many others I am not impressed with this new update. The app has been crashing, telling me I'm not a premium member, stopping mid song, and the biggest one for me right now is the fact that Spotify will not transfer over to my SD card for storage, I have a lot of downloaded music and now I don't have the room to listen to music without WiFi. The user interface isn't my favourite either, I definitely was a large fan of the previous update, this new one is harder to navigate and such."
Spotify,hosein azadi,5,8,"I've been using it for a couple of years now and the thing I really like about it is that the app learns your taste of music and after a while you won't need to find the new music, music will come to you effortlessly. and there's this thing that would be to great implemented: when i shuffle my songs in the library, instead of randomly queuing up what to play next, it stabilizes the mood while randomizing, like putting together the songs with the same gerne."
Spotify,Steffen Wolffe,2,4,"there should be only one! I have Spotify installed on two different devices. my cell phone, and my tablet. there's no reason it should be active on two devices simultaneously. I don't need a remote control on my phone for my damn tablet which is just a few inches away. get rid of this dumb feature for it running multiple devices at the same damn time it's sucking up my battery. I should not have to force stop this app on a separate device that I'm not even listening to..."
Spotify,Pooja Bommireddipalli,5,59,"Spotify.. u guys. All i wanna say is that i hope that JESUS blesses u guys abundantly cuz, I've been wanting to listen to these Christian podcasts and all i ever found a link to was a podcast that has to be paid to listen to. But bless u guys for Spotify, those are in here. But a tiny kind request. i love behind the lyrics by genius. i want that to stay, but with that i want full perfect lyrics to guys. Like i wanna sometimes just adding with it or just see the lyrics. So can i get an update?😊"
Spotify,Berjaedict Bruno,1,35,"I've been using Spotify for more than a year now and I can say that it is a great app for music streaming. As much as I love the music selection, can you please add an option to just simply go back to the old layout 'cause the new update doesn't display the typical song list (back in the old layout) which I prefer (or almost all the users). Thanks Spotify for your service."
Spotify,Morgan Selby,2,,Has an impressive list of music to listen to. The search system is simple once you get the feel for it too. I was originally impressed with it but over time the frequency and quantity per event of ads has increased. Used to be one or two but now there are times where I have to sit through 4 or 5 consecutively. Very disappointed. if the ad quantity or at least the frequency they pop up drops then I'll happily change my rating.
Spotify,TheTrue LastChef,4,,"so the issue I'm having at the moment is if I go out of the app and use something else, when reentering the app to switch playlist a add will block me. making it impossible and any time to dismiss it will take me to the current song playing and going back will only result in the same repetition. the only way to correct the issue is to close the app fully and not have it run in the back ground then reload it. which sucks as I'm usually very busy. Help? but other then that love the app."
Spotify,G. T. SECT,5,2,"Spotify Premium is 100% worth the monthly subscription, if you listen to music all the time. Their genius algorithm takes the struggle/frustration out of finding new music/artists similar to the music you already love. Every Monday, they create a new playlist of songs they believe you would like based off what you listen to. With premium, you can download any songs you want to play offline. You can also create unlimited playlists or search ones made by others. Truly a music lover's bestfriend!"
Spotify,Max Evans,5,45,"Over the, what I believe to be, almost 3 years I've had Spotify I've never had any problems with it. I've had premium since I can remember and it's such a good investment, almost every song you could think off as well as useful updates on artists you follow. One little niggle I have with Spotify is that if you try to add a song to the queue, sometimes it'll play the song by accident."
Spotify,Tracy Coyle,2,2,songs stop and start constantly. it's taking 10/15 mins to listen to one song. it will randomly stop. I forget I was even listening to music until I'm walking round shops and the song starts playing again for 2 lines before cutting out again. happens both bluetooth in car and listening on phone. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. not very good at £10 per month.
Spotify,Donnie & Krystal Dorman,1,2,"All of a sudden my music randomly stops. I can't restart unless I unlock my phone and reopen the app. Very frustrating when it happens every few songs. I have spotify playing 12+ hours per day and I pay for premium..... I shouldn't have to babysit the app. Also, ALL the playlists play the same songs over and over. I try to discover new music by creating a station off a song I like and it's all the same music. Considering going back to soundcloud"
Spotify,A Google user,5,16,"Great Music and Sound, relaxing.*** The only thing that isn't cool about Spotify is that I have been double charged now for 2 months. And before that I was getting charged "" ""Premium ""but I couldn't access Premium. That went on for 4 months! So if I could just get word to Spotify that they owe me for 6 months Premium service definitely, I would be very happy if Spotify would not charge me for my Premium service for 6 months, ""One account"" is all I can use. $9.99 once a month Please!!!"
Spotify,Carl Mountney,1,27,"I had prmium for a while but didn't use it that much so the free option was better as I didn't mind listening to the advertisments. But recently it crashes everytime an ad is due, freezes at the beginning or at the end of the ad. Reinstalled it and it worked for a while but then started again. Unusable now. Shame really, don't wast your time."
Spotify,Zac Lewis,1,7,This app was by far the best free music streaming app on the market until recently. the most recent update has made it almost impossible to use. I have to unlock my phone after every song and between every ad. I know they put this in place to make us look and listen to the ads and it's trash! using this app and trying to exercise is now miserable. Moving on to Pandora.
Spotify,Alix Mia Lagassé Gallant,1,22,"Yikes, since last update the app really got worst. Can't use alphabetical sorting in the artist section unless I follow the artist? and even then, theyre all in the same bunch not separated by letter. This really isn't an improvement, in case you weren't sure..."
Spotify,Jaciel Leyva,2,1,i give it 2 stars because the suffle is horrible. it doesn't suffle all of your songs that you have saved. it only does a small group and it's quite annoying having to go back and hit shuffle again to jump to another group. once i find a good substitute to work with Alexa I'm leaving this application. the worse part is that I pay for premium to such a basic service.
Spotify,Damion,1,19,I'm just going to use Apple Music. You have not fixed the disconnect issue with the bluetooth in the car and the app stops playing music when the phone locks. I was paying for premium but it seems like a waste of money if I have to keep unlocking my phone to restart my music while I'm driving which is a safety issue. You continually update the app with no information about what you're updating but not fixing the important issues and ignoring the complaints about the app not working correctly.
Spotify,Sharon Wong,5,12,"I have a premium subscription. Spotify is well organized, easy to use. I use my Amazon echo devices to play music from Spotify. Favorite feature is creating my own playlists. Spotify has recommendations to add to my playlist based on the songs I chose. Recommendations are a great way to expand my song collection. Podcasts are included in my subscription. Option to download playlists to listen offline is useful. Only thing missing is lyrics. Amazon Music has lyrics."
Spotify,Emma Creasy,1,2,I've been a spotify customer for years and loved the service and never had any issues. Recently it stops playing songs just at random until I unlock my phone and press play again. I thought at first it was something to do with my Amazon echo however after looking at reviews this doesn't seem to be the case as others are all having the same issue. Hope they fix it soon or I will be going else where and asking for a refund.
Spotify,Ryan Scott,3,4,"I've always admired Spotify for it's easy use and great library. However, I'm trying to come away from Apple Music and this latest version of spotify seems to be a step backward and not a good swap. Where are my saved songs? Where are my downloads? Why cant I just shuffle all my songs? Why do the artists in my library take me to the artist page and not my saved songs? I dont understand the library system and why it needed changing. Until this changes I'm sticking with Apple Music."
Spotify,Martin Armas,1,13,"i used to love it, but since the new update it, it COMPLETLEY SUCKS! i cant view all my artists in order nor can i select to see all my songs that are saved. im forced to make various playlists and i hate that! the new update sucks and i hope you guys do something to either revert it back or fix these problems with the library function. i will continue to discuss with people to stop using this app until its fixed. Almost all the people i talk to hate the new update."
Spotify,Pradeep Menon,1,9,"The app UI as well as selection of music is GARBAGE. Swipes don't work. Can't shuffle. Half my favorite artists are missing. Not even sure why daily mixes stopped working. I definitely won't renew my subscription after the free trial. But the biggest surprise is how bad Spotify is, after hearing about it for years."
Spotify,Sam Mansfield,2,,"its honestly pretty bad. the music selection is pretty good, but i listen to a lot of underground so it feels a little drab. ive encountered numerous issues, errors, undesired features, things i wanted to disable but couldnt. not to mention, its very difficult to integrate my former mp3 library into my spotify library, which is very easy to do with google play music. to think all my friends have been putting up with this app for $10 a month for years is honestly shocking"
Spotify,paul folland,1,,"Have been a fan of spotify for a long time. But recent update is not good. my library is saved to phones hard drive, but every time i turn my phone off or no battery it wipes it and says not enough space as trying to save to sd card. i have uninstall and re install to be able to select where to save music, then have to re download everything. Beginning to be a bit of a pain now. up until then apart from the pioneer option to pair with amp has been good."
Spotify,Amelia L-W,3,,"At first, when i subscribed to spotify it was honestly great. I had loads of songs to choose from and listened to some podcasts so i was happy paying the £9.99 a month. But recently i wasnt eligible for the £9.99 monthly bill. instead i was asked to start paying for a family subscription which is £14.99 a month which i wasn't ok with paying so I've cancelled my subscription. I'm disappointed this happened because i loved using spotify but I'm not ok with the monthly bill going up for just me."
Spotify,Simon-Pier Chamberland,1,7,"they had a promotion for a google home and they would not give me one because i had the $15 plan instead of $9.99. they made me downgrade to later tell me i was not eligible for it anymore. the app has been slow lately as well, i used to love this app but recently its been struggle. specially that they dont have a live customer support."
Spotify,Michael Choy,1,31,"Last update was terrible. I used to be able to save songs and play offline if i didnt absolutely want to use my data, now thats no longer an option. Trying to play a song from my existing playlists just plays an entirely different song that ive never even searched or heard of. If this doesn't get fixed, what's the point?"
Spotify,Shawn Ng,1,30,"Since Spotify updated its new UI, the alphabet scroll bar is gone. You can't save an individual song as an album (will all lumped into a playlist if you do) but have to save the whole album, you can't add whole album to a playlist (have to add song by song), you can't see what songs you have saved under an artist on the artist tab (the artist tab is literally useless). Worst of all, it takes more than 5 seconds to open an album on the album tab (no lag opening playlists or podcasts). 0 star."
Spotify,Jose Cruz,5,7,"for me having the spotify-music with ads, it's still awesome to hear great music. The selection of music is fantastic and I have to be honest with you, those that give you false reviews so you can go somewhere else, are really just blowing smoke. Give this app an opportunity to prove it's worth , you won't be disappointed."
Spotify,Matthew Richards,5,,"Just an overall amazing app. Selections are great. Tracks you wouldnt think would be on here are there. playlists made custom to you FOR you based on your most listened to tracks is amazing. I pay for the premium, so I remember what it was like without premium, but I would say it's worth it. A lot of control and options make the premium route worth it to me. WHAT'S EVEN COOLER!?!? I wouldnt hype this app up if it wasn't all that. IT PAIRS WITH YOUR SHAZAM AND AUTOMATICALLY CREATES A PLAYLIST!!"
Spotify,Nutmeg 45,1,,"As a premium user, the UI is the most terrible of any music app. No ability to search for songs in a playlist, no ability to view all downloaded songs and the search feature gets stuck in a permanent loading cycle if you're internet drops out for even half a second and is incapable of getting out of it without rebooting the app. These were these features previously there. The design team seems to consistently remove features with every update."
Spotify,William Oraine,5,1,Ever since I discovered Spotify through a friend I've acclimated to having music in my life 24/7 and Spotify makes it so easy to do. When I get tired of the same music I just go check out my discover weekly. A massive library of music to choose from and the ability to download it if you so choose ( for Premium members only) make Spotify my number one go to music app.
Spotify,A Google user,1,4,"I dont know if it's just my phone (Samsung s9) but songs would randomly stop/app will crash all the time, sometimes multiple times in just one song. I pay for a student account so I'm upset that this is what I'm paying for."
Spotify,Anthony Moniz,1,25,"app keeps freezing. can't skip songs, songs randomly stop. this app worked completely fine before the update now it's not usable at all. thinking about canceling my subscription. it's a waste of money if the app does not work. also my phone is Samsung s9. just got it so it's not like I'm using an old slow phone."
Spotify,Taylor Schloegel,1,16,"I loved this app until the update. my app is always freezing and songs are constantly no longer avaliable. I cancelled my subscription and went to prime music instead. The app used to be so organized and I could look up by artist in alphabetical order, podcast, playlists etc and now I have to individually search them and it's a hot mess. It is frustrating to navigate and so unorganized it drives me crazy, so I had to cancel my account :("
Spotify,Evi Handiani,5,6,"satisfied for using it for free because almost every song that I wanna listen are available even the old one, jpop, kpop en many others, so I decided to use premium. everything is perfect except for one. no lyrics available, so we can't sing along. but since every song I wanna listen available here. it's still my no.1 choice for streaming music."
Spotify,David Rojas,3,10,"It worked until it didn't and now i have $400 dollars worth of nothing because I bought my Onkyo to play music using my phone and there is no way to do this after the latest app failure. My unit does not connect to my phone, the app freezes, firmware updates are leading nowhere and I regret not buying Toshiba. I would recommend to STAY AWAY FROM ONKYO."
Spotify,DementedEye Warren,2,10,"So first if all I love Spotify, by far the best music subscription service ibe used but the new UI that they've made has completely gotten rid of the ""All Songs"" list so I can't just shuffle all the songs in my library, it's just made it so much less convenient to shuffle my music if I don't know what I want to listen to."
Spotify,jens Vranckx,1,15,"since the last update, I only get a black screen or the log-in screen, which doesn't work. I was logged in before, but can't access any playlist. Stop messing around with something that works instead of ruining it for everyone. I'd like to see my premium access compensated for the affected period, but i doubt that will happen."
Spotify,Nick M,1,40,This app WAS the best. Once it updated to the latest UI it became trash. You can't use any bluetooth commands while using it anymore (ie. no changing songs or adjusting the volume via headphones or car) I had it on shuffle today and it played the same shuffle from yesterday and earlier today while I have over 5000 songs. It also is not playing a lot of songs it used to that I have downloaded. While playing music if your phone is locked it will stop mid song and you have to open the app to resume.
Spotify,Karluis Mitchell,1,8,The latest update got rid of the my songs tab and honestly it's a pain. I see no way of listening to all my downloaded music without having to add all my songs into a playlist (manually might I add) and listening to them in that way. I'm probably unsubscribing if I dont find a way to listen to all my songs in a single list.
Spotify,clea vage,1,3,"Since I've installed the new update, I've had to re-download my downloads twice, it won't play my downloads in out of service areas or on flight mode. I've paid for a premium subscription and have sent multiple emails with no reply. After my month runs out I will be deleting. If I could give half a star I would."
Spotify,Author T.L. Manning,5,15,"I have had a subscription account since 2012/2013 and I don't know what I would do without it. I am an author, and having the ability to create my own playlists has become part of my work day. in the past year we have upgraded to the family account, and couldn't be happier. my son loves jazz, my daughter loves current hits, and my husband is a rock fan. literally, fun for the whole family."
Spotify,Gaurav Manna,1,24,"You guys really need to fix this app. The last few updates has completely ruined my experience. I am not sure if it is a S9 Plus specific issue or all android phones, but the song keeps pausing frequently in between (even downloaded and streaming on good internet) and it's frequently ruining the experience, especially in bluetooth mode when I am driving and the screen is off. Will really consider changing to another music streaming app if this keeps happening."
Spotify,Ki Ki,1,11,"the new update is terrible. its confusing to navigate. i relied a lot on my recently played to have quicker access, but now i cant do that unless im online. and now i have to follow artistes to have them in my artistes tab, which means they are currently out of alphabetical order. i would revert it back to the previous version"
Spotify,Jared Ball,1,37,"Have been a user for yesrs but the latest UI update has completely ruined its functionality. My library has been removed all to be replaced as playlists? and then i have to follow an artist just so i can have their 1 song i like pop up under their name? My library should be left nice and basic as the song ive selected, in a nicely sorted manner."
Spotify,Madalyn Zierke,1,20,"My music won't play unless my screen is active. This is horrible. I've been using spotify for years and now I'm considering uninstalling it. I can't have music playing while I work out, while I'm cleaning, or while I'm driving because if the screen goes dark the music stops. FIX IT SPOTIFY. DO BETTER."
Spotify,Benjamin Rafuse,2,1,"I love the content, library, and generally the whole service. What I don't like is that I cannot disable the autoconnection as soon as I get in my car. Add the toggle under aettings and I'll gladly upgrade to 5 stars."
Spotify,Luke G,2,3,"Offline mode seems intentionally clunky to turn on and off compared to other streaming services - I guess they want you to keep using data. The new update gives a heart next to the song in your notifications, but if you click it it'll remove the song from your library. Would be easy enough to avoid if they listed actual app changes on the playstore instead of just ""leave updates on automatic!"""
Spotify,David Coleman,1,2,Terrible customer service. No help whatsoever. The music selection is great but all the recent changes are disappointing.. I no longer have the songs that I individually picked out for each artist. Spotify makes the decision for me. Their algorithm makes my decisions not me. I giess I'll be moving over to Pandora.
Spotify,Rahul Aggarwal,2,2,"The recommendations available in desktop app are different than those on Android app. There are lesser recommendations on Android app. I'd like to have same recommendations on Android app as that on desktop app. Secondly, on the Android app there is a bug. When we are served the full screen premium trial ad, sometimes the ad does not respond to our attempt at closing it. Iean the full screen ad is displayed, while the touch input corresponds to the app elements under the advertisement."
Spotify,Chad,1,3,"This new version is awful. i can't just select an artist and go to the albums I've downloaded to listen offline. why put out an ""update"" if it makes it worse, is there no quality control? Does nobody even ask how others use this app. if it's not fixed in a week i will stop paying for premium."
Spotify,Shubham Tandon,5,1,"I tried the free trial version for a month and loved it. The best thing about the app is it's customised playlists. Those are just amazing. It can improve a bit though, by adding a field where i can see all my downliaded songs in one place instead of them segregated into playlists. that would be helpful."
Spotify,Gavin Ruane,4,282,"I'm a little disappointed; free users get the new design and features while premium paying users have to wait? That makes no sense. I'm paying $9.99 because I expect to get the better experience. How is giving the free users the best experience and leaving Premium users with the old Spotify proving that I should pay for Spotify? Otherwise, it's a good service at the core: a lot of music, cool features, and good personalization, but I can't say it's better than other services."
Spotify,Michael Burke,3,19,"I do really love the app but every time I run out skips on my Playlist the app begins playing songs I didn't add and that I don't enjoy. I don't understand why the app adds songs to my Playlist, it seems like it's just a way to irritate people who don't pay for premium until they buy it. I had premium and it didn't do it once. What a dumb gimmick."
Spotify,Dianne Gates,1,13,this is my fav music app except the recent update keeps cutting off. I didn't know if it was my phone however I read a review similar. please fix!! never mind. I canceled my subscription. still not fixed.
Spotify,Matt Vidious,1,11,Some recent update caused the app to start trying to connect to Waze. I don't even have Waze installed on my phone. I don't just want to disable the notification. I want Spotify to stop trying to link to other application/services without my permission. I have the only waze setting turned off. Still says waze is connected. Fix please.
Spotify,Kryna Tebbetts,2,11,"I pay ten dollars a month for a music app that pauses and stops as soon my lock screen closes. switched phones, updated my app. rebooted my phone. it still does it no matter what I do. even ones I've downloaded do it!!!!"
Spotify,Bob Beelzy,2,9,"frustrating - settings continually change at random. quality, volume, and most importantly where my songs download frequently change, resulting in poor quality of music, and worse an overload of internal memory, which happens weekly at random. I have to change and redownload my music to my sd card, only to have the app switch it back to my internal memory resulting in a crashing phone and a massive redownload, frequently. This also happens with the integration with Waze. PLEASE fix this."
Spotify,Ralph Barreto,1,1,"Doesn't work properly - since the update I have had problems with casting to a chrome cast. Whenever the bloody ""Clash"" advert comes up it lets out the advert and then freezes - the next song doesn't play. Even when I disconnect the cast and try tp connect again, the first thing that appears is the Bloody ""Clash"" advert again and the same happens no matter what I do. Please fix this bug its ruining my experience of spotify."
Spotify,Paige Beaulieu,2,,"Since resetting my password via email sent to me, I have not been able to login or use the app at all. I haven't seen anyone else have this issue so there is the possibility I may have gotten virus. Regardless, I'm posting this in the hopes of hopefully seeing someone else have this struggle and maybe figure this out."
Spotify,Reluctant Pit,2,,"Worked great until it locked me out and said my password was incorrect. I had the app remember me just in case I logged out. So how is the password wrong? I have not changed my password in all the time I have had this app. First review I have ever done on an app, disappointed that it was spotify."
Spotify,Nunni,1,,"Before the update that just happened Spotify was perfect for listening to much on the go. You guys just did an update where I can no longer view my saved music and have it sorted by artist. I now have to manually search for artists to listen or scroll through one big page of ""Liked Songs"". Terrible change and I have cancelled my subscription until the app had been made easier to navigate for my music."
Spotify,Robert Mower JR,1,11,"When will you be fixing the issue of your app not connecting to the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro. I've sent numerous emails to your support folks and am repeatedly told this is an item thats being worked on. You're taking my money for a ""Premium"" membership but not providing the service you advertise. I'm beyond frustrated with Spotify."
Spotify,Lorenzo Trento,3,,"the App is having some strange changes on design and some changes in the way you see informations or have ""shortcuts"" to see the artists. other point I would fix is add an option to choose if you want to see the tumb of the song, or the video (personally I prefer seen the tumb of the album) The reproduction is good, nothing to say about that ;)"
Spotify,Linus Sundberg,3,3,"Has a great (not perfect) music collection but has several problems -there's a limit on the amount of songs you can save -you can't change the order of an artists albums to chronological -you don't see the amount of plays a song have -took away the notification bell which made you know when a artist you follow releases something new -live albums, interviews, compilations, remix-albums, re-release albums and more are mixed together in the same category -a lot of albums has the wrong dates And more"
Spotify,Kristin Rupert,5,1,"I love love love this app! Spotify offers any song you can possibly think of! It's also amazing that with premium, you can listen offline without using your data! I just love being able to pick and play any song I want to, anytime! I would definitely recommend the Spotify app to anyone! 👍😁"
Spotify,Richard Payne,5,4,it'd be 5 🌟s if I wasn't experiencing frequent app closures. it only happens when i close the screen. its frustrating since I'm now paying for the service. the service is great when it's working. update: I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and now it works perfectly! five stars!!!
Spotify,Sahil,5,6,"I use this app for multiple hours a day and I think it is great for the most part. The only things that need work on are 1)song selection: multiple songs should be allowed to be selected i.e. when adding/deleting to a playlist. This is a feature of many other music apps so I'm not sure why it isn't included here. 2)auto rotate: I'm not sure why, maybe it's because of the number of playlists I have or something, but auto rotation does not work when I'm on the main current song screen. This is frustrating for me since I'm in the car for 2hrs every day and can only mount my phone horizontally."
Spotify,A Google user,1,3,"It happened again!!! It seems like Spotify doesn't want the users to switch to offline mode. Well, I don't mind that if Spotify is going to pay for my data package. Once I switch to offline mode, the only way I can reconnect to Spotify is to uninstall and reinstall the app. So that is how Premium subscribers are treated. I dread to think how those on free subscription are treated. Wake up your bloody idea!!!"
Spotify,Alif Akhmizan,4,28,"Totally the best music streaming I have ever used. Almost complete music database, with weekly new music discovered. However, some old songs that I have liked were greyed out. Meaning that, the song were kicked out from Spotify database. Minor problem, but some of the songs were my favourite one. Hopefully, there will be student price for Malaysian students."
Spotify,Ivan Cornelio,1,,writing for the current update dated (05/26/19). I am dissapointed that the app can't play the songs remotely using the phone connecting to a computer without shuffle play. Not a regular premium user but I literally loved this feature before. I hope they think this through because it is not a great feature.
Spotify,Tiffani Freeman,1,2,I love this app I have premium and everything but when my music is playing and I turn my screen off every 2 songs or in the middle of songs it stops the music and sometimes it just stops the song and resets it to the beginning of the song it just started within the last 3 months! I want a refund or something done!!
Spotify,Jay Burke,1,5,"Had this app for 2 years, premium account, and today I was abruptly logged out and have been utterly unable to regain access to my own account. Customer service was diabolical and said I would just have to make a new account, there was nothing else to be done. Thanks for nothing Spotify."
Spotify,Jo Jo,1,1,"advertisements after every 2nd song. the advertisements are making me want to throw my phone out of the window. I get that you need advertisements, I really do, and the presence of ads is not the problem, but do these ads have to be so freaking annoying?? always the same spots, always the same annoying voice. makes me want to switch to deezer or just any other music app. Like I said, the presence of the ads is completely legitimate and fine, but they make me lose my patience. seriously."
Spotify,Makrand Patwardhan,4,1,I loved the app. There is one suggestion to add. A particular song can be part of one or many playlist. When I scroll through such playlist I happen to like a single song multiple times. The more time I keep hitting like icon the more time it appears under my Liked playlist and more over it gets downloaded multiple time as well which takes up space. I would like to suggest either to filter such songs so that they dont get added multiple times or to add an option to mark duplicate in Liked list
Spotify,Shiny Shiny,3,,"Unfortunately, it just keeps randomly pausing which, since I pay for premium, is incredibly annoying almost the point where it's unusable. I've tried disabling the battery saving mode on my phone but it doesn't have any effect. Napster is a glitchy mess but doesn't have this same issue."
Spotify,Nick Badamo,3,15,"Spotify is great and some of the issues I've had with the app have been fixed, but some things still aren't working. Spotify has been stopping my music sometimes for no reason, and it has been having trouble loading lately. Also, the play/pause and forward/back functions have not been working on the widget or my lock screen. There are also other things I wish were added, like the ability to add a song to multiple playlists at once and bringing the search and sort bar back to playlists."
Spotify,Marty Lyons,1,11,I was a paying customer for five years. i had someone using my card information and when my phone was stolen all my information on it was stolen as well. email and phone number was then used as the thiefs info and spotify refused to recognize my issue and allowed this thief to keep on using my account. so ive veen waiting for this company to maybe do the right thing and research my payment history and reimburse me by granting me a new account and service that has all my music in those account.
Spotify,Joseph Bates,2,,"Used to be a great app, but since the update it can never recognize my SD card, and constantly tries to move my library to my internal storage. Additionally, their organization is horrific for anything other than pop music, since they don't differentiate between composer and artist at all."
Spotify,Simon Conroy,2,5,over the last say 2 months the app has gone downhill!!! I have the galaxy S10 and I have been unable to skip tracks from the lock screen like I could before....i was able to get over that but now all my downloaded tracks just un-down loaded themselves and if I try to download them now it just says waiting to download which with a Google search this seems to be an issue for many users! seriously considering jumping ship to deezer
Spotify,Logan Peterson,3,1,"This is one of the few apps I find worth the cost. Free access to a huge selection of albums is great. Now for the negatives: --The app is quite aggressive. Try as I might, I haven't figured out how to stop Spotify from automatically opening upon startup of my PC. Also, the app seems to randomly open on my Smartphone. If I give a particular song a thumbs down, Spotify should get the hint and stop trying to get me to listen to the performer of said song."
Spotify,Saksham Arora,5,11,"The music experience, it's just at it's best!! and with premium, you live the rest 🙌 1 thing that i found un-cool about this, was some songs weren't available in India on this app. i mean like... Wth?! 😑😑🙄🤨 but otherwise.. it's the Netflix to music 😎"
Spotify,Brianna Love,4,3,"I'm writing this only in the hope the creators will see it; I love the app and have no problems with it, but I would really like to have a navigation type bar on the side where you can jump straight to a letter if your songs are sorted alphabetically. The search function is good, but I would prefer a navigation bar."
Spotify,E4STLONDONG3N3RAL,1,5,"horrendous. DO NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM. you pay a monthly fee to download songs to listen offline, but constantly deletes downloaded music. so once you are offline you have to use up your data to listen to the music you have PAID to have downloaded... haopens constantly. terrible. waste of money."
Spotify,Humphrey Karanja,3,5,Good app. Could be better if you could rewind Daily mix when screen is locked. This feature only works for my playlists. The loud music warning needs to be disabled as it is dangerous when driving since you need to look for the tiny OK button. Maybe have a driving mode or loud music profile where loud music is enabled.
Spotify,Aryan Sharma,1,4,"very worst experience. its been 1 week and my phone continuously download my whole library every night, consuming my 30% battery and 2 gb of data. I have reinstalled it multiple times but the issue remains tbe same. I have contacted the Spotify service, but they are even unable to reaolve the issue. I GUESS I HAVE TO SWITCH TO ANY OTHER SERVICE."
Spotify,El El,2,1,"This app is surprisingly bad. While it does have most mainstream songs available to stream, it has a lot of issues. The one which bothers me the most is how the app handles playlists. Playlists are tedious to create and are made public by default. If you want any playlist not to show up in your profile you need to make them secret one by one. Furthermore, saved audiobooks do appear in your song list by default, which renders that folder useless. (I am using the premium version of this app)"
Spotify,Joel Purnell,4,48,"Best investment I've made in a long time. I stream in my car with Android Auto, stream on my PS4, laptop and Chromcast. I can also use the web player at work where I can't have smart phones and what not. There's always gonna be an artist not yet well known enough to be on there but they're very very good about getting artist out there. I always recommend it over Pandora or other services. Wish there were more music videos though. *edit I tend to have issues with the shuffle function though."
Spotify,Dan Swindle,1,3,"I love Spotify and it is the only music streaming service I use regularly but, as of today, there has been a serious issue with the app. On my 20min bus ride today I was unable to get it to work long enough to listen to a single song. Each time I open the app I get a loading screen with the Spotify logo and google smart lock at the bottom. It flashes off and on for a few minutes, then once the app loads, the logo goes up again. This is a cycle and I am unable to listen to music."
Spotify,Raymone Bashar,1,1,my account suddenly disappeared and I cant log in and im a premium member i pay money. I tried cintctin them but you basically cant in order to contact them you need to have and log in to your account. what??????? retards
Spotify,vipin bisht,1,6,"Many songs are missing some EDM,Tomorrowland tracks & more. and we aren't getting every latest songs in india. There so are many English songs not available in Spotify. ""I don't care""song by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber song was already released on Friday but is not available in Spotify India but it was already on gaana & apple Music india on Friday.I wasn't expecting this from Spotify. what's the point of paying for premium membership if we aren't getting latest songs on time. I'm not gonna pay."
Spotify,Ciprian Cucuruz,2,1,"When using Chromecast Built-in music playback frequently hangs on ads and occasionally on some tracks too. Restarting the mobile app restores the advert banner but not playback. It is impossible to recover from that without switching the TV to a broadcast channel and relaunching the mobile app to re-establishing the Chromecast connection. Even then, Spotify insists I should listen to that same advert again and, guess what – it hangs *again* at the same timecode. That's when I switch to YouTube..."
Spotify,Henra Dwikarmawan,2,,"Not open the app for weeks and now when I open it, I was told to log in again. I do so, but always loop back to log in screen, although I already log in with correct ID and pass. Already tried to update but no hope. The app just crash when I log in and kick me back to log in screen."
Spotify,Meghana Karkada Suresh,3,1,"Pretty good library of songs but Spotify needs to make the songs available here in India. The advertisements sometimes do not close while playing music and I am forced to shut the app. Please fix this bug. Also, where's shuffle play? I would also like to customize my playlist more by rearranging the order. Hope to see improvements in the future."
Spotify,Raphael Sulat,1,1,"Dont download this if you are looking for a free app that gives you or lets you play the music of your choice with just using wifi. This app needs you to pay premium in order to let you play what music you want to play, because its free version needs you to shuffle play a whole album and you dont know where in line the music you want to listen to. unlike when this app is just starting, so sad to see how this app turned to a greedy, bloodsucking, money making thing. I'm really disappointed!"
Spotify,Heaven Buchanan,2,,Good app and most ads that come with the free version are alright but stop including car horns and car crash sound effects in your ads. A lot of people drive listening to this app instead of the radio and you're threatening our safety by including these stressful and potentially panic inducing sound effects. Why? Please be more considerate of your driving listeners
Spotify,Barry Raw,1,1,Absolutely stupid interface. Can't turn off shuffle mode. Totally counterintuitive. Come on Spotify. it's not rocket science. I've seen on some blog advice to drill into the menus to the song that's currently playing and tap the crossed arrow icon. but I simply don't have that on my galaxy A9
Spotify,Johan van der Does,4,,"edit, since the latest 'upgrade' when I listened in the car via bluetooth, every time the screen shuts down the music stops, was very frustrating and dangerous. Have since realised that the background app setting had reverted to off. Turned it back on and the issue seems to be fixed. Have adjusted the rating accordingly."
Spotify,Ricardo Miranda,1,3,"i have a premium for almost a year now, but it keeps on crashing today. what's happening? if this keeps on crashing this week, I'll stop my subscription next month. still crashing, damn!"
Spotify,Nik Brooks,2,134,"""SPOTIFY PLEASE READ"" I have knocked down to 2 stars from 5 because this new UI is really bad - ""guys if ain't broken dont try to fix it"" Trying to navigate through this updated version is just ridiculously bad. Downloads get lost when you reboot your phone, can no longer remove recently played and what's happening with offline mode? it is slow to load, overall this is seriously bad. I am a premium member and really don't want to cancel, so please revert back to the previous layout.. thanks."
Spotify,siri c,2,1,"Why Spotify India doesn't provide some songs which I can be able to listen when I use vpn?? I'm an EXO-L, I want to listen to exos songs but, Spotify India doesn't have their 4th and 5th albums 😡😡😡 do something real quick, and the suggestions suck! I would listen to some songs on loop daily but my suggestions keep suggesting me other songs which I don't like and don't wanna listen and are not related.. fix this."
Spotify,Damy Evers,1,3,do you want an app with a user interface that somehow shows less usefull information than your average antivax pamflet? do you want an app that mixes music in your playlists handpicked by a algorithm that cant even tell the difference between a rock song and a medly cover? do you want an app which add system is so broken it can show you 10 for 3 minutes of use? do you want all this designed by a dev team that thinks that skipping said unwanted songs should cost €10/m? DO I HAVE THE APP FOR YOU!
Spotify,Meliedy Lanasa,1,1,"Issues with Samsung Galaxy S10  I recently upgraded my phone from Samsung s7 edge to an s10.  The app malfunction and freeze whenever I use it with my new phone especially while using a Bluetooth headset. The app freezes or takes a long time to load options.  Seems that this has been an ongoing issue for months and no updates have been made by spotify.  Therefore I cancelled my premium account.   I might come back when the issue is fixed.  For now, they are not getting my money for an app that I can't use."
Spotify,Camden Rebekah,4,,I like this app in all but one thing I don't like about it is that ya'll have too many ads and It sucks having to be interrupted by a stupid ad. I rather listen to my fave music then listening to these stupid ads. ya'll have to many ads and I don't enjoy it😠so please stop doing these ads they're so annoying!!
Spotify,Thuan Dong,2,1,"subscribed a premium member, song quality just normal event I chose streaming very high quality, if you wanna hi-res music, don't subscribe it, wasted money. file size maybe high but real quality is low. they never control it, you even do not know what quality of the song you playing (128kbps, 320,500, lossless...), bad service otherwise is ok."
Spotify,Legend Lowell,3,11,"App has had some issue with the last 3 updates. First it would boot me out everytime I tried to add songs to my playlists, then it started not even registering when I was connected to the internet, now it does that more frequently! I'm so freaking frustrated with this app now. If it wasn't for my playlists I would go over to soundcloud instead. The american and Japanese indie selection is much better there."
Spotify,Amitava Dutta,5,3,I have been waiting since 2013 ... when I was a 9 year old for this platform to come to India ... after a long wait it came ... glad to see a lot of regional content too ... but it need to increase its stock of Hindi and Punjabi songs for India ... otherwise this is a great app
Spotify,Aayush Mishra,3,,"Its not as good as i expected. There are a lot of songs which are not available in India, making it a not so good Music app in India, despite being worldwide famous for its content and variety of songs. Please Spotify!!! Make it better and ultimately the best."
Spotify,Caleb Barnard,1,1,"I have been a premium user for years. But ever since the last update, I have not been able to download music/playlists for offline uses. It keeps saying that I have discovered a premium feature. I've tried signing in and out several times and nothing has changed. Either fix this bug ASAP or give me my money back for features not working properly!"
Spotify,nath wills,2,,"I want to know why when ever I lock my phone the music stops, I've deleted the app an re downloaded it, I'm even paying for it now and it still happens and to be honest it's really pissing me off now... since Ican't seem to be able to contact anyone through the app I'm hoping someone can help me here"
Spotify,scott rossback,1,,After the latest update it continually pauses playback when the screen isn't on and they made it almost impossible to see all of the music that you saved and downloaded. Browsing music in your library SUCKS now! I used to love this app. please fix it so that I can love it again.
Spotify,Matthew Ryan,2,6,"honestly used to love this app but this recent update has completely bombed it, it keeps pausing randomly when my phone locked and its incredibly frustrating especially when I'm on my way to work. never ever had a problem with the app in the 15 months I've been using it but Its just a shame."
Spotify,Russell Toelke,3,4,"I use this constantly. There are glitches, but overall the music selection is next to none. Cannot seem to solve the constant ""you're offline"" error. I would gladly pay more to leave original studio versions of songs alone. I abhor live versions and remixes."
Spotify,Deril Jose,3,2,Spotify is a great music app but the indian version does not have most of the songs from famous artists (like Charlie Puth) . Please bring all the songs that you have in the other version to the indian version.
Spotify,Alice Wokaigi,1,,"can u make the app more like the desktop version?id like to listen to my songs without shuffle play, have infinite skips,and actually have 30 minutes ad free,because 10 3-minute songs is not 30 minutes.Also,maybe make it so that you dont have suggested songs at the beginning of a playlist?because i want to listen to the moominvally soundtrack,not some stupid wwe music that i dont care about.soundcloud is better when it comes to having an app version,because they have infinite skips and less ads."
Spotify,Laura Jackson,1,2,"I use Spotify all the time and loved my premium account until the new update, now I can barely use it. I listen to Spotify mostly in the car via bluetooth, but now the songs pause everytime my phone goes to lock screen it seems pointless having my account, I can't unlock the screen whilst driving. I've tried all the workarounds but it still doesn't work. It's such a disappointment!"
Spotify,Tessa Regina,2,3,"The app was excellent until few days ago when I updated to the latest version. Somehow the update makes me unable to listen to the songs I had downloaded when I'm offline. I purchased the premium version last month with the discount offer of paying 1 month for 3 months premium. Right now I'm online with a wifi and Spotify is re-downloading all the songs I had downloaded. I'm not sure what Spotify wants to achieve with the new update, but it clearly makes me doubt to extend the Premium version."
Spotify,Viren Bhaga,1,4,"So slow and laggy, I pay for a subscription and the app is rarely even usable. It is 90% of the time showing me the spinning circle on a 350mb broadband line. Time to find a better app if this carries on."
Spotify,David Rafael,3,4,"I like Spotify a lot and have used it for years. The new update on my s10e stops playing when my phone goes to sleep. All I have to do is make up the screen, but then after a minute or so, music stops. Sometimes only seconds. Frustrating! 😡 Fix this, please!"
Spotify,Mohammad Kaif,1,5,I don't know what went wrong but since the last update the app is not playing songs even in the lowest quality with high speed internet. I'm using youtube at 1080p without buffering but I can't play songs in low quality with the same connection. Something must be wrong with Spotify.
Spotify,Greg Baker,2,1,"The app is just way too buggy. I don't understand how independent hobby developers can write flawless apps yet a big company like Spotify can't seem to get this app right. ""No internet connection"" when I clearly have a connection... ""Now connected to waze"" when I don't even have waze installed... Come on guys."
Spotify,Blackpink I STAN The chosen k-pop one,1,1,"STUPID reason why is because when i was loging in, i entered the right combination for my account then it said that i entered the wrong combination and sent me an email. it took them 2 months and still counting and they didnt aend me the email... like now, i made a new account and hopefully...THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN."
Spotify,Destiny Parks,5,1,first of all I just wanna say thanks for a good quality app that's is not a scam....this app has the best music selection and it's all based on your preferences you don't have to listen to random asongs...and if you want a more personal experience just get premiun...but tbh you don't even really need it
Spotify,Gerald Callaghan,1,3,"New UI makes the app so frustrating to use. No way to see your library of recently downloaded albums, no recently played, slow loading times sometimes doesnt even load at all. The UI was so much more intuitive before."
Spotify,Karan Cincheuri,2,4,Please fix the music label deal asap. I'm a paying customer and now it's starting to get on my nerves that I'm missing out a huge chunk of music! Also what's with this new ugly icon update. What were you thinking adding a black border to an already adaptive icon???
Spotify,Charlotte Byrne,1,2,Not working!! I had an email to reset my password and did that. now I open my app and it switches constantly between the home screen and the loading black screen with logo on. Therefore completely useless and not working! I have reset my phone and uninstalled the app more times than I can count. Sort it out Spotify this is so poor and ridiculous!
Spotify,StrikerDaKid,1,1,"It was a good app, but recently I've been having to log in everytime, and when I enter all my information, it starts over. Until this is fixed, I have to rate 1 star because its unusable."
Spotify,Satyamshree Moharana,1,,"i have been decieved, I applied for students plan for premium and my bank charged me 59rs but spotify said it was an unsuccessful transaction and i wanted refund but such support couldn't be found inside app or website. Community blog was useless also. If you are seeing this Spotify please help me out of this situation. It's unfair to get charged 59 per month whole year and still not getting any premium facilities. I tried twitter help too @spotifycares but no one replied."
Spotify,Tyler Brown,1,5,"Annoying lock screen banner says Waze is connected - I don't have Waze. Progressively been going downhill for a couple of years. 1. Songs in Playlists are no longer available. 2. Get message ""Spotify can't play this song right now"". 3. App loses available devices ALWAYS! Maybe Amazon is better...?"
Spotify,Seth Wilson,3,5,"First off it's way better than pandora,but if the premium was less you could really compete with apple music. One issue is the shuffle play, I have big playlists and want them to be truly random to be surprised by what it plays.Not the same order of songs every time I play one playlist, its annoying and ruins the song.The one feature where you could move the songs around manually you removed.if you fix these its try a five star app."
Spotify,Sophie Waters,5,9,"too many ads and you cant listen to any specific song, unless you have premium which is totally worth it. It is a reasonanle price, comes with hulu, easy to quit, you can make your own playlists, and listen to any song, album, playlist, artist."
Spotify,PepperMintier,5,2,"I spent years trying to ignore this app. Years staying loyal to iTunes. Then, 18 months ago, I downloaded Spotify for the first time. 6 months ago I purchased premium. The app continues to impress me with its customisation, selection, and quality."
Spotify,Deron Pressley II,1,1,The latest UI update has ruined spotify. I've used spotify for years and my personal library had every song I've ever liked since high school. Honestly there's no point in having Spotify anymore without being able to select the songs you want from your own library. Rename the App to iHeartRadio Jr. and just call it a day.
Spotify,Ezra De Guzman,1,2,"For the nth time, sPOTTY-fi just deleted all my downloaded music and again refuses to recognize that I am on an Android that has a microSD card. And I only find out about this when I am out, I don't have my laptop to delete the cache to get it to recognize the microSD card, and I'm in a place with spotty mobile internet."
Spotify,Evan Hodda,1,3,"the new interface is harder to get around, why are the artists i don't follow shoved down the bottom and not in alphabetical order, and if i want to download all my songs i have to like them individually instead of saving the whole album at a time"
Spotify,Sumedh Garimella,4,,"when it works, it's great. however, there has been a recurring issue where the app randomly pauses, changes volume, and skips through a playlist without any input. please fix this, it's a pain having to delete and reinstall to quick fix the problem."
Spotify,CD Notrum,4,1,"its a good app for getting the music that you want but if you don't get premium, then when you have the 30 minute, no ad thing it doesn't always go for a full 30 minutes and you have to rewatch it and wait for it all over again. it gets annoying but it is a great app otherwise."
Spotify,Adam Kee,5,9,The UI of Spotify is getting better and better in every update. But I'm not sure why but the connection is very bad when I use it with my cellular data. WiFi worked just fine. Otherwise the app and music quality is just great. I hope connection can be improved though.
Spotify,Nathan Poirier,5,3,"since last update, listening to spotify with bluetooth is completely broken, music is always cutting and skipping songs from bluetooth device doesnt work anymore. When it will be fix, I will give back the 5 stars that this app used to deserve!"
Spotify,Saiful Abdul Rahman,1,53,"dear Spotify programmers, for the sake of us premium users using Android phones. I'm getting tired repeating this over again after each update still with the same issue. Spotify have failed as a basic music streaming app, keeps pausing on locked screen while listening via bluetooth headphones. i don't care much abt the new UI n stuff but as a music player that CANNOT play music continuously really sux big time! and now it gets worse, APP will QUIT on its own!"
Spotify,Butterking,3,2,"Been using Spotify for a while now but the reason im giving it 3 stars is because it randomly deletes all my downloaded playlist and its kinda irritating. And if this happens, i have to use my data to just stream which sucks cuz im paying spotify monthly and this method is wasting my data. Pls fix it. Or at least reply to me if theres any solution to this."
Spotify,Alpha Tots,1,2,"spotify is broken! Since I updated the app, when my screen turns off music will stop. I am a premium spotify member for the past 4 years or so and this is the first time this ever happened. I cant get my workout done at the gym since music keeps shutting off. thus I have turned to Google music. I want my monthly payment back since this is UNUSABLE!"
Spotify,JMarcos Suazo,3,3,I like the application however there are three things I hate: 1 - After so much time knowing my musical profile they still offer me reggaeton (is it really Spotify?). 2 - There's still no option on Android to hide artists and music that I do not like. 3 - There is no option in the application to see the lyrics and equalize the music.
Spotify,Anon Anon,3,1,The shuffle play feature doesn't shuffle properly. lately it keeps playing the same song twice before shuffling to another song which then gets played twice. can we please get a proper random shuffle feature that shuffles through the entire catalogue of the artist work not just a select few tracks that gets repeated ad nauseam.
Spotify,Lachlan Gerrety,1,,since the update my experience has gone from 5 stars to one. every time i play a song with my phone locked it plays about 1/3 of the song before skipping it. Ive restarted my phone and reinstalled the app. in order for it to work I have to have my phone unlocked with the app open.
Spotify,Sierra Jones,1,,Yea that update from yesterday did not fix the problems caused by the previous update. Still cuts in and out. only works if app stays open on screen. Who wants to continuously drain their battery like that??? What am I paying 10 bucks for?? FIX PLEASE!!!
Spotify,Lee Clarke,1,,great for music but some ads come through with very loud beeps much louder than the music and have no warning. I've been left with headaches and my ears ringing after I've been assaulted by the loud high pitched beeps. Spotify do not care about damaging listeners ears because they're directly profiting from it.
Spotify,Ernest Camilleri,1,,"Like, many many many others, I too am having problems for the last month or so.. Freezing up, stops mid song constantly rebooting its self. At present, I am uninstalling app n then reinstalling to see what will happen. I hope you don't hear from me again."
Spotify,Γιαννης Χασιωτης,3,,"yo for real though, I can't choose between artists in my library because that option is completely GONE. Now I have to either search the specific artist I want so I can listen to them or go to the ""liked songs "" what is this? Bring back the old Spotify for God's sake.."
Google Play Music,Valiant,1,348,"Google! Listen to what A LOT of people are complaining about! It's crashing big time! Big hassle! Often have to uninstall and install. But that only works for 1 or 2 days! A big company like Google should have figured this out by now, especially if you're paying ten bucks every month! I predict a mass exodus to Spotify if this issue continues! Fix it and I'll give it a four star for beginners."
Google Play Music,Alex Sides,4,316,"Can you please add a feature to move settings, like the equalizer, to a 3 dot 'more' button menu in the upper right corner? Also, can you please give an option to make creating playlist faster? For example, being able to create a blank playlist and add from there, with song recommendations, like Spotify does. And one last thing, can you let users change the background color of the app (not everyone likes orange) and add a Dark Mode please? Please make these changes, or do these for YouTube Music"
Google Play Music,Jacob Lackey,1,735,"By far the worst music app I have ever used. Almost all of Google's apps are great, except this one. Selecting a specific song is impossible. I search a song, I click the song, I click ""play"", and it plays a completely different song. It might be thar this app only plays stations and not specific songs, but this should be fixed."
Google Play Music,Chiagoziem Okolo,4,15,"Great music. I wish they had less mainstream songs too but what they have is sufficient. Also, songs and even whole albums seem to disappear from my library every now and then. This is a hastle because when you have over 1.5k songs like I do, you dont notice for a while and you have to go back and redownload them. please fix"
Google Play Music,ACE Productions_19,1,421,"does not work, no problems taking your money though. recently it just kicks me out of the app, can't do nothing with the pathetic app. ok so im reading a lot of people are having this same issue. songs play a few seconds then kick you out of app. their was just an update that I thought was guna b the fix but absolutely not."
Google Play Music,Raman Thakur,1,6,"The recent update has bugged my music app. I am having issues with song selection in Honda Accord 2019 via bluetooth. Tested my Note 9 and S8, both are having the same problem. When I select a song on my car screen it doesn't play the same song but randomly a song from the list. And on some instances it plays a song one above the one I select. Please fix."
Google Play Music,Rudy Messex,1,70,"I have 1200 songs in my music library. When I search, it wants me to start a trial of the online streaming service. Settings won't let me change it to tell it to only search my music library. If f I want to buy new music, it again wants me to subscribe. I don't want to subscribe. I just want to listen to the music that I have already bought with ease."
Google Play Music,Abdul-razaq Twaha,1,25,"Worst! i can't even see all of my songs in your app. i have over 300 songs but your app displays only the ones i have added recently. Whenever i update my songs infos, the changes dont appear in your app....when i delete a song..it still appears...hell of a joke of an app...especially when it comes from the mighty ""GOOGLE"""
Google Play Music,Youce Torres,1,22,"""By far the worst music app I have ever used""—Couldn't agree more. Google, this is bad, and you should feel bad. Kind of ironic to say but the *searches* are terrible, the way it sorts out the music is not intuitive and it takes too much time to load a simple song. The catalog is worse than Spotify's or Apple's; even Tidal has a better interface. And it forces you to compare since it doesn't have any community-oriented program or information that gives any value to the service on its own."
Google Play Music,Jim McLean,2,3,"After I created and downloaded a playlist, songs would disappear from the device. they show up faded and with either a download symbol or an exclamation mark. When I touch the song, it either says wait because it is downloading (which is not true), or it says the song is not available. Also, it will not let me make a downloadable playlist longer than 100 songs. I work 12 hour shifts in a remote area with no internet connection, so 100 songs is not even enough to get through a day."
Google Play Music,Yura Kazmirchuk,3,34,"It's super outdated. Google has updated every single app, except this one. Quality is good, however, the interface is buggy, sometimes just to download an album it takes me 10 minutes because i need to remove it from my library, then add, then remove and try to download again and so on. All in all, it would be a great app if Google finally decided to update it."
Google Play Music,Evan Lassiter,1,7,"There are already plenty of albums, songs, or particular versions Google Music doesn't have and won't get added. But there are also songs you actually do have but then magically disappear. According to support, songs and albums can be deleted by the ""owner"" at any time and once its gone, its gone. All of this has gotten old real quick so I've looked at other options and instantly found all the songs I've never had here and the songs that were ""deleted by the owner,"" are on these platforms"
Google Play Music,David Tom,2,16,"The longer I have google play music, the more they are cheating their customers. when I first got the app I could ask google to play for example 80's pop hits and I would get the actual artists. Now I ask for types of music and I get the music with other singers doing the song but who can't even hit the right notes. It is like I am trapped in a karaoke world except, I am not drunk. After hearing them sing, I wish I was. Stop cheating your customers and use the actual artists."
Google Play Music,Irene R Anderson,1,28,App won't connect to my music purchases. My music is gone. At a standstill for ordering more music. Just finished reading the reviews of this app. I am horrified. Never expected this. I guess I should have researched before buying. Buyer Beware. Tech reps are very accomodating and patient but could not fix my problem. Was passed on but have had no response. Back to the Tech reps who unfortunately have to hear from me.
Google Play Music,Blake Johnson,3,2,"I've been using this app since it was introduced. I'm a paid subscriber and absolutely love it because I can add my own music library to supplement what they aren't able to provide. A VERY recent update however removes any remix information from the queue. If a song on an album is a remix it will show as such on the album page, but not on the playlist or Now Playing. I hate that! If I'm listening to a Gui Boratto remix, why tell me on the track listing then make it impossible to find again?"
Google Play Music,HdPredator,1,17,"Great app but one big key mistake!! It's a great app to manage and play and your music but they have one stupid thing that has been the same way for years. If you show all your songs and then begin to scroll through them and you try to click on the eclipse on the right that shows the options such as add to play list, they keep it so close to the dam scroll bar that instead of hitting the eclipse you hit the scroll and scroll through your music. So freaking agitating!! Been that way for years!!"
Google Play Music,Rich Tomlin,4,14,"Great app, used it for years. One annoying thing is when I scroll a playlist, especially when the playlist gets to the end, it is too easy to cause a false swipe to remove a track from playlist. This happens all the time and is really annoying. At least there is an undo option but if you miss the undo, you e lost the track forever! Make it less sensitive please."
Google Play Music,Victor Pina,1,7,"I have to uninstall the app cause it started crashing but when I tried to install it back is not allowing me to do so, but my subscription is still active, what's the problem? Besides, I can say this is one of the worst music app I've ever used. I doesn't have all of the songs you might looking 4, if not while you're been paying 4? And editing your play list could be a nightmare. Fix it!"
Google Play Music,David Scott,2,13,"Bug filled, like everything else Google touches. Playing random songs to my Bluetooth speaker the volume will just ramdomly go to zero. Repeated nags for their paid service they've got a better chance of seeing God than me signing up for. Won't play anything but playlists on Android Auto because the clowns are trying to push their paid service."
Google Play Music,Amber Hegele,3,13,"I've used this app for years and loved it. However, recently it has been glitching and only playing the song for the first few seconds and then going mute. No matter how many times I pause and replay the song, it still won't have any sound. I only got it to work by playing a song on a different platform (Pandora, YouTube, etc.) and then hitting play on Google Play. Ugh. Seems like I'm not the only one having this issue. PLEASE FIX! It's driving me crazy...."
Google Play Music,WAYNE CADDELL,5,1,"They've come a long way. It's my Go To, music player, then of course Napster and TuneIn Pro for my plain Radio. For professional DJs who don't want to jug around hundreds of Cds around, Google Play Music allows you to upload all your music so it's all on the Google Play Store Cloud. It's way better than iTunes. My only complaint is that there's not a place to share Google Music with others."
Google Play Music,福安赖,1,19,"I was using Spotify, but had to go on vacation and couldn't use Spotify anymore. So I went back to listening to my downloaded music on my phone. Found out everything changed and it's now part of Google play music. first day worked just fine took a long time to get it to work. Now I can't listen to my music at all. I have tried all of the troubleshooting for my kind of problem I am having, but nothing is working. Wish the old phone player would work and that I didnt have to go through this App."
Google Play Music,Shan Sharma,1,24,"If you are confident about the App you created being competitive why asking for payment details for the free trial period? Instead of asking me to cancel anytime within 30 days to avoid charges, ask for the payment details while on trial seeking feedback if your App lived up to the expectations. The model now is just expecting someone to miss that 30th day and you could charge for a month. Very bad! I don't see any improvement in the layout or the listing from the time I've been using this App!"
Google Play Music,Samantha M.S.,1,17,"the app does not work! every few seconds into a song the app stops playing the song. I buy my music though Google and it's easier to use this platform to play them all. sadly, regardless of the complaints from other customers about this problem, they have failed to fix the issue or, at least, inform the users of the problem and when it will get fixed.Poor customer service and product."
Google Play Music,Peter Sherwin,1,20,"It is a pain in the rear to retrirve purchased songs from Google Play Music. Almost all of the time, despite being able to play the songs you have just bought, you cannot locate them on your mobile handset despite using the very best file explorers. So you turn to Google for help, and this leads to a merry-go-round of nonsense that, for all of the issues surrounding it, I never dealt with when I used Apple's iTunes to purchase and download music."
Google Play Music,Scintae,3,3,Can't edit song info..leads to an unorganized library. And the songs I've got in my app won't sync to my computer so I can't listen to it on desktop or use the desktop function to edit the song info. How am I supposed to comfortably choose music and make playlists if the titles of songs I've added all show up as question marks? I can't know what I'm about to listen to until I play it.
Google Play Music,Bri Cook,1,14,I've used this app for YEARS. I pay monthly to use this app and I've gone days now not being able to use it on my phone. Works perfectly on the desktop but not here. It stops playing and won't work. I have to uninstall and reinstall for it to work! I'm thoroughly unimpressed and heavily considering moving to a different music streaming app.
Google Play Music,Rica Gardere,1,12,So the purpose at this point has GOT to be to force all of it's current and past customers to simply start building our music libraries all over again with a different provider. But I want every single penny that I've spent purchasing music from Google back! So you just quit operating the app but keep all of our money?! Smells like a massive class action suite is brewing!
Google Play Music,David Radford,1,7,"used to like this app, but since the last update (May) something has happened. Music from my Amazon account, which I get free when I ordered certain CD'S, will now not show on my music app. I can find them in files and they work, but will not go into the audio section. Not happened before. Why update something and make it worse."
Google Play Music,Aaron Moses,5,21,"Been using GPM for 4 yrs now. What keeps me here over other music streaming services is its chromecast ability and ability to manually upload music into your library. It's a great service...however, it's in need of an update. While all of the other ""google play"" apps recieve clean/shiny new interfaces, GPM is left looking archaic. Since Google is unfortunately looking to end the service within the next year or so (in favor of YT music), they don't seem to be putting much TLC into the app. Shame."
Google Play Music,Brian Hudzik,1,8,"Would be nice to download your purchases...which eventually you can. Just be prepared to want to smash your phone in the process. One of the worst music apps out there. Extremely disappointing since it's Google's own system. Also be prepared for songs not to stream, both purchased music and playlists. Just a hot mess."
Google Play Music,Scott Outdoors,2,7,"Works well, just a couple missing features to match 3rd party podcast apps. Needs option to mark episodes as 'already played'. This is helpful for folks coming over after years on other podcast apps. Also needs option to download episodes for later playback in places where there is no cell reception. Huge problem driving out west where you can go hours without reception. Add those two features, and I'll raise my rating from 2 to 4 stars, 5 if you add something extra that exceeds my expectations."
Google Play Music,Vladimir Olujic,1,26,"Keeps stopping play after a couple of songs, or if I skip an ad the image shows like the music is playing but there's no sound. Every time I have to ""kill"" the app, clear cache and open it again, but it doesn't necessarily help. It's been like this for months. Please fix this. So frustrating to go back keep closing/ opening it. Thank you."
Google Play Music,Cole Greenwood,1,13,2 reasons that made me uninstall this app (even though it was the default music player on my phone) 1-When I asked my Google assistant to play music I already owned (by name) it would search Google Play's suggestion of song names instead of my offline music. So it just didn't play anything because I don't subscribe. 2-The app plays ads when I listen to my offline music. I should NEVER have to listen to ads when I have already paid for each of the songs I am listening to. No other app does that
Google Play Music,Brett Johnson,3,1,"So much room for improvement... curated music isn't great. I'm feeling lucky radio gets repetitive. Tends to box you in on musical preference to the point where you want to export your likes and blow away your history just to get better recommendations. Widget options are poor. Need dark theme options and transparent widget options. Overall, it's nice to stay in the Google ecosystem but if i didn't have YouTube Red with this I'd be out."
Google Play Music,Sydney,1,11,"I *paid* $15/month for this service and I *was* somehow still missing podcast episodes that I had to use other apps to listen to. And the layout is just obnoxious... I was constantly accidentally rearranging my music, podcast episodes don't autoplay, you have to subscribe to change the episode order, you can't leave reviews like every single other app. It just seems ludicrous to me that you charge that much. Whoever designed this app obviously has never actually used it."
Google Play Music,Soumodeep Sen,3,1,The app is good. But there should be an option of creating one's playlist by selecting own desired songs in that playlist. Moreover there should be an option of dark theme background or atleast changing the background of the app. The app doesn't let the user to change a name or album name or singer's name of any song in particular. It is bit disappointing because an user always expects the best from Google LLC as Google is truthfully reliable. But these changes should be introduced by an update.
Google Play Music,Dkota,2,1,"This app could be so much better. I have had countless glitches and bugs happen to me. Crashing, stopping my music randomly, some songs I can't even listen to it because it randomly skips 10 seconds of the song EVERYTIME it comes on! Sometimes when you like explicit versions of songs it will put the censored version in your playlist even if you dislike the censored version. I just now have been having issues where certain songs literally crash the app and any other apps I was using. Horrible."
Google Play Music,Band Geek,2,2,"This is a mediocre app at best, which was fine for me. I don't like the design, but it's playing music for me. I haven't used it in a few months or so, but after I went back to it, the app keeps crashing and nothing will play for longer than 10 seconds without closing out of the app. Please fix this I have songs I want to listen to that are only on there."
Google Play Music,Meagan Irwin,5,311,Love the app. I can either make a play list and download it so I can listen to it when I don't have service or I can listen to their stations. App is very easy to use not confusing at all. You can have multiple play lists instead of all the songs being on the same one. Been using this app for acouple years now.
Google Play Music,Dshamill8899,5,1,"LOVE💙 I listen to every kind of music out there.. As a musician that writes, produces, engineers my own music... I am obsessed with quality first. For the last year I had used Apple Music.. luckily I came to find the LG V35 Thin-Q... and I have never been so happy. This phone has what is called a HiFi-DAC.. which is basically a built in headphone amplifier that converts the audio you listen to (with aux in phone) to a higher bit depth (sounds like the original&amazing)..Google & LG = Amazing 💙"
Google Play Music,Robert,1,10,"I am so disappointed with this app because it crashes when I open it and play about 5 seconds of music.I have a Galaxy note 9 which is more than capable of utilizing the app.I have to uninstall and reinstall the app in order for it to operate properly. Unfortunately, in about 24 hours or so the problem just comes back."
Google Play Music,Aisha Page,1,11,"i am unable to play the music I paid for... for the past 3 months (or longer) When I start to play music, the app just stops and closed after 3 seconds. I tried to go and follow the troubleshooti g directions with no success. i am about to cancel my membership because I am so very frustrated ."
Google Play Music,Charles Pulaski,1,1,PLZ PLZ FIX MY ISSUE!!! I have always loved this app UNTIL NOW! It has always been amazing and has always had whatever song I wanted. but lately since I got my new Samsung Note 9 and the recent update for Google Play Music anytime I start a song not even 5 seconds into the song it completely shuts off and goes back to the home screen on the phone please please help with this Google and I will gladly change it back to the five star review which it has always been till now
Google Play Music,Gillian Parker,4,3,Cuts off randomly and closes... I have tried different settings and knew that it would do this if it's on shuffle but it closes randomly no matter what. It's a great app but that one glitch is really irksome if I'm listening in the car.... In a state that is hands free.... And it closes. I have to wait to reopen it again.
Google Play Music,Ken Oliver,1,13,"Thought I would give Play Music a go, but this app sadly falls short on many fronts, the main one being no crossfade option resulting in silence between songs so totally useless at parties when you need nonstop music. The album art is zoomed in too far so artist name/album are off the edge of the screen, the garish white background cannot be changed, no equaliser.....The Spotify app manages all of the above successfully, so I have to go back to them!"
Google Play Music,Van Britt Allen,4,2,I like the app but I'm a little disappointed that I had purchased for a year and didn't cancel before the next year begin and I was only several hours late from canceling within the time frame and being obligated to the second year of purchase which I'm fine with its just that I can't access the app now? Go figure!!
Google Play Music,Mike Ernest,3,2,"The app itself is great and I'm glad this service is tied to being a YouTube Premium member. However, it would be nice if Google did a UI update, especially for the albums sections for artists. Generally speaking, the singles and EPs are under the full LP discography but why not separate it by having and Album section and a Singles/EP section to not seem so jumbled? Also showing the release year under the album art would be a welcomed addition to the app."
Google Play Music,Cherise Miller,1,19,"Can someone help me? this app was working perfectly, now it plays one song for about 10 seconds and then stops altogether. As a music lover, I'd like to enjoy my playlists on repeat. I can't do that now, because I can't finish a song at all! I thought maybe an update was needed, but this is not the case. Any suggestions? I really don't want to have to download everything again on another app, but I will."
Google Play Music,Grim Reaper,3,4,"Hey I got a really 2 big problems, I got two music albums 1 has 186 songs which shows all my music and the other album has 103 song but when I open the app album 2 doesn't show all 103 songs it only shows 69 songs why does this happen?(next problem) When I go in the music settings and try pressing Manage Play Music History it says ""we can't load your history right now please try again later."" I uninstalled and installed it back and it's the same problem please fix this."
Google Play Music,Me Too,1,6,"I am uninstalling this. A word to Google - Not everyone wants to be streaming music all the time! Stop deleting the music I've legally bought and downloaded, and stop deleting my playlists. you're not the only player on the market, and I will no longer be using your services on my phone!"
Google Play Music,Jason Betts,3,10,"the app is easy to use, and quick to pick up the only criticism I have is not all the old albums are available, but some are and you have some cd's and others you have to go to another service to track down it would be great if you had the track I'm looking for so I don't have to bounce back and forth , thank you for the content you do have."
Google Play Music,Johnathan Storey,3,5,The app and service is great although it is not perfect. The album artwork is zoomed in amd is sometimes pixelized making it very unclear. Uploading music to your own library is kind of a headache at times and it kills my smartphone battery. FYI i have a galaxy s9+. with all of this said i would highly recommend this app to people that want to moves their CD or wma collection to the cloud. Although wma is not supported there are plenty of 3rd party tools to convert those files to mp3's.
Google Play Music,Ross Bauer,1,8,"Mediocre at best. often has issues connecting to play a song, especially after switching from wifi to data. Have also had issues with downloaded songs refusing to play offline, as well as the app refusing to function offline. pretty much defeats apps purpose. now the app essentially refuses to download any music whatsoever. sitting next to my router with perfect internet access and it took 5 minutes to downliad one album. Took me three triea to get it to work. cancelling my subscription"
Google Play Music,Rerin Lunghar,1,6,"Man this app is junk. How to you change your song language recommendations Google? I live in India and all I get are Bollywood, Kollywood and tollywood songs.I dont care a single but about them. I just need my English songs but all I get are songs in this languages that I dont speak. If there's an option to change it then I havent found one. Fix this ASAP."
Google Play Music,anny comsit,1,2,"It crashes every time I want to use it. It starts sometimes by itself. In cases where I succeed to start a track (usually the same track as it doesn't let me open others), I can't stop it anymore, have to close the app. The app is acting crazy for the past month. Please fix it"
Google Play Music,Cresencia Tolentino,5,1,"Google music is important not only to have a music but the App we need for other way for important picture. specially to the artist. They need to protect their picture because bye force they work always to public. And also almost all networking. They are poor for that because absorved them. They are always in the Technology. Sometimes I can sing only of my own, for relax. Complements all working always to networking. To Networking needed Healthy, more Patience to public person, educated and sweet"
Google Play Music,Isaiah Thomasson,1,1,"This has to be the worst app google has ever designed. The user experience is fu**ing torture. Poor button placement. Search function completely ignores songs in ""my library"" and insteads opts for videos, stations, etc. Cuts of songs like 30+ seconds before the end. really kills the song and ruins the transition, making for a bad music listening experience. Also they insist on zooming way in on album art cutting of the sides and distorting the image. DO BETTER GOOGLE, ITS SUCKED 4 YEARS!!!"
Google Play Music,Joey S.,1,10,"When listening to free music, often, pop-up ads stop the playback. I tap on my pixel buds for a bit like a fool, then stop what i was doing to pick up my device from my pocket an close the pop-up ad manually to resume playback. This is frustrating, considering I already listen to audio ads."
Google Play Music,Kyle Way,1,1,experiencing random buffering spikes. Only the song is not buffering it's just playing silently and after about 2 or 3 seconds it continues to play. I honestly have always loved this app but it's been going on for about a week now and it's driving me nuts. Fix and I will change rating to 5 stars
Google Play Music,Carol Murray,3,1,"New update did NOT fix my problem. I was listening to a playlist and in the middle of one song, the player started scrolling down rapidly through ALL the songs in the playlist. I cant listen to anything. I updated the app hoping that would fix it. It did not. Please help!"
Google Play Music,Rachel Woltman,1,6,Ever since I dropped my subscription the player can never play a station over wifi without glitching out trying to play an ad. I have to completely force close and restart to fix it. Notified dev team of the error and no response. Has been like this for months. Finally stopped using and switched to a different streaming app.
Google Play Music,Jitender Gupta,1,1,"is this Google's product? This app performance is wrost I felt made by beginners developers not a Google's development team. music are not playing if you have high speed internet and they are asking for paid version. why? If, I have to for this app sorry for it, more apps are available in market better than it."
Google Play Music,Trevaun Welcome,3,1,overall the app is ok. but music Discovery is horrible. it favors mainly hip hop. finding new music from a specific artist is s headache. you literally have to know the name of the don't before hand and then search for that. playlists are also very weak. absolutely need to work on your curated playlists.
Google Play Music,Dávid Halmi,1,1,"piece of cr4p. it plays even downloaded-to-device songs (tried on 3 phones) all glitched up like K,,K,K,KKRKKRKRKRDKFKKDKRKDRK DDDKDKKDDKDKKFKFKDKRKTKTKTKTKTKTKTKTKTKTK. support consists of unhelpful droids, no solution found anywhere. i want to refund all my songs to my account balance and buy a music player that can play tunes, like my $10 mp3 player back in year 2002 because seems like google music is not capable of doing that simple thing."
Google Play Music,SociallyAwkward Bean,2,1,"nearly every single time that I go to listen to music on one of the stations, the song either refuses to play, skips a bunch once it starts playing & stops, or it gets frozen on an ad and the app stops working. it's so irritating to not be able to use it because of that."
Google Play Music,Code Ken,1,7,"I don't know how to use it. The Help is not actually helping. If I tap the three bars in the upper left corner, there are only five options: Listen Now; Recents; Music Library; Settings; and Help and Feedback. I can't really use it even if it is already updated."
Google Play Music,Robert McAdams,1,1,"Latest ""updates"" have broken the app so when i resume a podcast mp3 (over an hour long).instead of resuming where i left off, paused it RESTARTS the file instead. Mildly annoyong when it is a 3 monute song, INFURIATING when it is an hour long podcast. The hilarious thing is that it never used to do this. It only started when i finally let it uodate. THIS IS WHY I NEVER LET APPS UPDATE!🙄"
Google Play Music,Bria Hayes,1,42,"after today's update my music literally only plays for 8 seconds and cuts off, it was perfectly fine before the update ON 3/19/19.UPDATE: Its been almost a month and Google still has not fixed the app from crashing on my note 9 after now 10 seconds of the music playing before it abruptly stops. FIX THIS PLEASE,IVE ALREADY EMAILED YOU GUYS. Update:app still doesn't work after the 5/9/19 update"
Google Play Music,q q,4,1,"Great app. I can download all my music onto it. however sometimes it crashes and the only way to fix it I have to restart my phone. it's really annoying but it doesn't happen too much like 3 to 4 times a week. other than that it's great and when you are subscribed, it's a great variety of songs to choose from."
Google Play Music,Giph Snelgrove,4,1,I have a wish list for this app. I want dark mode like the other Google Suite products like Google Messenger. I would also like to be able to add all songs by an artist in my library to the current queue. otherwise this app had changed my life for the better!
Google Play Music,Jackie Zimmerman,1,1,"I've been happily paying for a subscription for over a year and for the past week every single song stops playing after 6 seconds and my app closes! No matter how many times I reopen, reinstall or restart my phone! Its extremely frustrating and this problem needs to get fixed ASAP!"
Google Play Music,Westin Fairbrother,1,7,even with a song I have purchased I can not listen to them offline. every song you listen to uses way too much data might as well listen to it on YouTube. when offline the song cant be listened to unless streamed. ince you stream the song it becomes available offline but at a high cost of data.
Google Play Music,Mister Forty,1,139,2019-05May-16: This app will forever stay 1 STAR as Google REFUSES to quit screwing up Album Art. ××××××××2019-03Mar-23: 🔴1. Please quit distorting album art. PLEASE. 🔴🔴2. I update my playlists OUTSIDE of the app. The app REFUSES to refresh them (so does Samsung's Music app). Is this an ANDROID problem? Both apps have full permissions.
Google Play Music,Mal F,2,8,"keeps crashing. I have used this sp for years and love it, but following updates it crashes a few seconds into every song. there is no point spending out on something this unusable, so I will shortly be cancelling my subscription. (very sad, because I loved this)"
Google Play Music,Gamer Dude,1,1,"Doesn't detect any of my music from my SD card. I did try following the method of clearing the caches, restart, unmounted and remount the SD card but still doesn't detect any music at all. Please fix this issue. Btw, part of me bet you gonna ignore this review anyway"
Google Play Music,Aheesha Gibson,1,7,This used to be one of the best music sites to me the only place you could listen to R. Kelly music I had made all my music playlist set up 3 to be exact Then likes 3 months ago the site stop working for me They need to fix the bugs and all that I had to cancel my subscription 😡😡🤬🤬 Ps. Going to spotify at least I can use the music for a ringtone... Google you really need to get on board with that
Google Play Music,Elizabeth Maier,1,4,I spent an hour trying to upload my music from my computer. I jumped through all the hoops only to have google sign me out every time I sign in. I drag and drop a music file and I get a notice saying I must sign in to Chrome. I sign in and then it kicks me out again or doesn't recognize I am signed in and asks me to sign in again. I give up.
Google Play Music,Apostle Gift Ngoveni,1,17,Telkom gives me data every month for Google Play Music but I can't use it as you keep insisting that I subscribe so you may charge me. So I am missing out on the service that I pay every month. I wish I can delete this app as it is useless to me.
Google Play Music,justin smith,1,16,retarded that I can't listen to music all the music on this app stops playing after a few seconds. all these guy's can suggest was use the YouTube music app. which I don't like using. just more memory on my phone I have to use up just to listen to music.
Google Play Music,Reann Hill,3,25,the only reason rated this 3 stars is because THEY NEED TO FIX THIS PRONTO. it keeps saying that this app has stopped or they are shutting it down! this is the only way I listen to music! if you guys get it fixed 5 stars easily
Google Play Music,Elizabeth Arce,1,1,"Not working since recent update I have it playing in my car and it only goes 2 seconds and says ""Google play doesnt seem to be working"" yeah no freaking way! I pay $10 for this and it hasn't been working. hope you guys fix this!"
Google Play Music,Ben Sportsman,1,11,"had this service for years, last week my debit has fraud. Card is shut off, and new one ordered (7-10 business days). Payment obviously wouldn't work. They didnt wait five days to shut off my service. Google you suck."
Google Play Music,Alex Ayars,1,5,Streaming devices have to be reset daily. Play Music application stops playing randomly. Streaming to Google Home devices has maybe a 50% chance of actually working. Infuriating experience.
Google Play Music,Toji Nola,1,7,"trash. why is it everytime i actually spend money and BUY songs, I always have to go through an hour+ of restarts, updates and other complete time consuming settings changes all to try to get my ""downloaded ""songs to appear on my phone, IF THEY EVER DO!!!!!"
Google Play Music,Lucas Workman,1,1,"Buggy as hell. Constantly has problems. between random crashing, just stopping music all together, getting an endless loop of skipping songs without any audio. I have to force stop the app at least 10-15 times a day The service is great. App is trash."
Google Play Music,AJ Lelievre,4,1,"Can you PLEASE fix the design? It would be really nice to see the entire album art instead of it being zoomed in. GPM is ridiculously overdue for a redesign. It's a good app, but the design isn't so hot anymore."
Google Play Music,Adam Jaramillo,1,1,"I'm seriously getting sick of the 1000 song restriction. I don't even want to use the service anymore, because I can't listen to all of my songs. I have to listen to them letter at a time, because I have 1000 every couple letters. I can't believe it. I hate this."
Google Play Music,sbcssmf,4,96,"i like this app and i use it a lot but can you update it, and add a new option that allows us to change the information on downloaded songs?(title, picture, artist, etc) It would make it way better!"
Google Play Music,kariahya smith,4,144,"I love it! The only problem is it wont let me edit the information (song title, artist, etc.)for the songs that I download. I would like the app more if I could edit the song information. Please make this possible."
Google Play Music,Kristina Beebe,3,3,Okay for music. Absolutely sucks for making playlists. The menu to add a song to a playlist is to close to the scroll bar. I have an awful time trying to make playlist without scrolling all over the place accidentally.
Google Play Music,maria Cap,1,1,i have just updated it....and completely unxpected everything was changed.....everything is indian but im not living there i cant understand why the top song even are hindi??? i want english ones ....what is it? anyone can explain?i search justin biebers name and surprisingly and indian star came 😑 how is it possible ?
Google Play Music,Nka Osaro,2,1,"...app is not refreshing on its own - I edited some tracks to a new genre, but it's still in the old genre (even after restarting). Please fix this. Bring back the refresh button please, if possible..."
Google Play Music,Clara Chao,3,12,"Has fewer functions than basic free music players. No ads, not very easy to click into ""shop for more"", so that's good for someone who doesn't make impulse purchases, or doesn't have much internet connectivity. Sound quality is acceptable. But player doesn't have loop function. And some kind of swipe gesture can result in deleting whole songs or albums from device storage, making it necessary to have a hard backup on a different device and OS. I don't even trust the subscription service."
Google Play Music,Beth Zilla,1,1,"Terrible! Keeps skipping songs and has done so for months now! ive logged out, logged back in, uninstalled then re installed the app and still does the same thing. After all of these complaints the stupid app still isn't fixed?"
Google Play Music,Fuzmorten,1,2,sucks terminally no Alphabet sort for song only your stupid shuffle! cannot distinguish between music and audio books but all book readers can tell the difference WHY??? last week it had Alphbet sort updated yesterday and it went away. Typical of the geeks at Google if its not broken they eill break it!
Google Play Music,Linnette Prewett,2,13,if you swipe right on your playlists it deletes a song. You have 2 seconds to undo this action. There is no way to look up to see what song you just lost. I've lost 100s of songs due to this non user friendly quick action
Google Play Music,Lee Burston,1,5,"it's sad the fact that we spend money buying music from the google store but not able be to upload and play other misic files outside of google. i just moved my files to google android music file, and then none of my songs was not on there, reset my phone several times and nothing yall seriously need fix this issue!!!😠😠😠😠😡😡"
Google Play Music,Eric Gottfried,5,1,"What is going to happen with Google play Music?? I love this app, the abilty to find music and up load your own. This has been the best music app ever. Google please let me know what is happening?"
Google Play Music,Kayla Lopez,1,10,"Not playing any music at all, it's fully updated and I am subscribed for a free trial and it wont play a single song. Not when refreshed, my phone restarted, or app closed and reopened, or after waiting a day. All apps, games, video and more music apps all function on my phone. I am glad this is only a free trial very glad I did not spend money for this."
Google Play Music,TheBrawler Md,1,4,"A lot of bugs like dont show the song photo, or the song is named,,a dollar,, and in alphabettical order should be first, but is after ,,back in black,, or i tap on the song, the seconds are going but it doesnt play, a restart the app the the song runs ok"
Google Play Music,Breanna Genot,1,1,Increase song limit from 1000. It is making this service worthless to me. I feel so restricted like I'm hearing the same song all the time. I can't create a playlist with more than 1000 either. It's crazy.
Google Play Music,Jenni Ayee,2,3,"I loved this app until yesterday. the songs on my playlist won't go to the next song, I have to manually go to the next song. I'm about 2 seconds from signing up for spotify. please can you fix this."
Google Play Music,Radoslav Stoyanov,1,3,"It turns out that I am paying a subscription for not being able to manage my devices?! No worries, it just turned out that I started saving money ;)"
Google Play Music,Josh Bingel,4,16,"There are a couple minor drawbacks. Theres no view for displaying all songs downloaded from Play Music only. It includes music outside of PM, which is understandable, but there should be a PM downloaded music only filter. Also, when Fb Messenger dings, it lowers the sound of the music, so when my friends are going nuts, it goes in and out continously. Haven't found a way to keep that from happening in either app. Other than that, I really like PM."
Google Play Music,Bradford Eckhart,1,2,Used to be great! Now it doesn't really work....I'm lucky when it plays at all. When it does it stops after one song and the spinner starts spinning (even with previously downloaded music).
Google Play Music,Dan Schlegel,5,6,"This is a phenomenal app. It is super great having all my music accessible through mobile. I have found this to be very, very beneficial. Thanks to all who have made this in my opinion one of the best music apps out there.  If you want all your music from iTunes on Play Music then download Play Music Manager. I have transferred thousands of songs onto my Play Music account. The amazing thing is once you load all your music from your different locations using Music Manager IT STAYS on Play Music. I have deleted and downloaded the play music app to test this out and sure enough it is all there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Google Play Music,Paul B,2,12,"Very basic, not enjoyable to use. Layout only supports tiles - so plan on scrolling forever. Need ability to easily delete an album without having to delete one song at a time. COMPLETELY unusable with Android Auto as it will not show by artist, albums, or songs. Sorry we cannot ""speak"" requests as we don't have memorized every song and album title in the library. App will not stop prompting to subscribe Google Play Music. Can't delete Auto Playlists."
Google Play Music,Torin Napier,2,2,"Google play doesnt allow songs to be played on other media players, and when there app doesnt work with android auto I am unable to listen to my purchased music while driving. stops randomly while playing and restarts songs that are interrupted."
Google Play Music,Mari-Anne Ramson,1,21,"Update: yet another update crashes the app every 10 secs. And guess what? it erased all my playlists, all my music AGAIN because I had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to stop, and it still closes after every song in your playlists when casting. BETTER TESTING MEANS NON-IRATE CLIENTS. Either make your damn app work properly or just give spotify your unconditional surrender!"
Google Play Music,Daniel Martin,1,8,"just singed up for the family music plan but it wont let anyone else that i have invited to it. add or download any music, if thats the case it a waste of $14.99 a month. not very happy about this...."
Google Play Music,Karan Choubey,4,6,"Fantastic app with a lot of bugs. This app has every song I ever want to hear with a large collection of songs and that's why I have subscribed to it. The interface is also fantastic and the quality of the music is excellent. But sometimes while streaming music to my Google Home with this app , it plays some other random song rather than the song that I've clicked to play. I am facing this bug for the past 4 days now. I expect Google to fix this bug as soon as possible."
Google Play Music,Sundar S,3,6,i listen to only tamil songs. This app is user friendly and ad free if you subscribe to it. It is intelligent enough to start playing automatically once you start your car from where you left last time. My only grouse is collection is not rich. Many popular songs are not available yet. With this megre collection of songs one would get bored after a month of using this.
Google Play Music,Arturo Blancas,3,1,"if you guys change the interface similar to the one on iPhones, I'll give it a 5 star. How is it that this app is better on an iPhone than on a android device?! Mekes no sense at all."
Google Play Music,Chad Bieber,5,5,"Great music streaming service! I've tried Spotify and I find Google Play Music to be far superior with a much more user friendly layout. Well worth my $9.99/mth. Only feature I'd like to see added is a ""normalize audio"" setting so that the volume of songs are the same, not some really quiet and some really loud. Keep up the good work Google."
Google Play Music,Lenny Leopere,5,9,When this app finally shuts down will be the last day I give Google money and my metadata I'll be blocking all e100 domains and ip's I'm done. I will also be making sure to dedicate time to helping people degoogle themselves.
Google Play Music,Timm Henson,5,7,"Been using this app for years. I always liked being able to go back and forth between my computer and my car listening to albums, podcasts, stations, and my play lists. Protip to some having problems: Try clearing your cache/data and restart songs. If you try and listen to music on a bad connection it will attempt to jump to the next song and never complete the download on the previous song in order to prevent freezing or long silences. Previously played songs are cached even if incompleted."
Google Play Music,Anton Petrov,3,1,"Well, At least add dark mode or night mode. Strange and non-logical searching. ""Top 15 songs"" that's ""awesome"". Where are rest of them? To be honest, all of strimming service are tricky or buggy."
Google Play Music,Justin,4,6,"Overall I like Google Music, especially being able to upload your own music. I fear thia feature will die soon though knowing Google. Why does google keep trying to distract people from its own services? as in why do we need ""YouTube Music""? The only thing that absolutely drives me nuts about this app is the cropped album art. People have been complaining about it since day 1 and its now 2019 and Google still hasn't fixed the issue. Despite it's flaws, it still has features none of the others ha"
Google Play Music,Fafa Enefkay,1,19,i dont understand why it changed after i update it...all my songs from my external memory was lost and i cannot re-upload back to the music manager. help page also was not so helpful after all. i cannot see any troubleshoot button or link as the helps suggests. i even click link to music manager and to google play web player it return back to the apps.even after few updates from google play.
Google Play Music,Ryan Fabello,4,7,"Would be nice if you can go back to previous songs when you enter the first song on your playlist, it seems the only way to go back to the end songs on your playlist is scroll all the way down to end of your playlist or keep pressing skip song button till it reaches the song you want."
Google Play Music,Stephen Mann,4,1,"Could be better with a few simple changes. 1) Support for multi-genre tagging. I seriously don't know why music apps don't seem to support this basic feature. The genres are most often separated out in a single ""Genre"" tag with a semicolon "";"" in between or tagged with multiple ""Genre"" tags. 2) Stop combining albums with the same name together! If I go to Blink-182 > Non-Album Songs, then it should only show the songs from that artist and not from every artist that has a Non-Album Songs album."
Google Play Music,tre murillo,3,5,"I've had a subscription for 4 years. In that time, no substantial features have been added, and it's mindboggling. They have all the data available to add functionality that adds value and drives engagement. Show me my most listened-to tracks. Add personnel for every album/track and let us click through to those artists. Allow users to share songs and comment on them within the app. It's a stable, reliable music streaming service. Just wish it had more to offer."
Google Play Music,james matzen,5,1,I do not know what is happening but I have google music on A Galaxy note 8 and the app is completely unresponsive. I have forced closed the app reopened it to the same effect. please fix the issue soon I need my tunes..
Google Play Music,Craig Holmes,2,3,"Slowly but, surely getting worse. Not keeping a connection to my other Google home products, shuffle and repeat have stopped working on different occasions and downloads aren't remaining in library. Please make improvements"
Google Play Music,Ian Cairney,1,39,seems good but at no point was i alerted couldn't change ny devices too many times as i had to reinstall computer due to windows issues and change to new phone so removed a few devices but stops me adding my pc back on as says i have removed too many this year when i reinstall the play music manager on desktop
Google Play Music,Mobile Tech,5,1,"I give a 5 stars, because it's a good music app... But in a last two days I am facing a problem, when a plug my earphone and play a song it will play a music for few seconds and suddenly stop and then again play and stop.. If i play a song on Saavn app then it will play smoothly and cool . So, I think it's a bug so fix it please."
Google Play Music,Dani Luna,1,4,"recently every time I try to play music using this app, it gets a few bars into a song & shuts off. what gives, guys?!?"
Google Play Music,Russell Cunningham,1,2,Don't use this app it steals your music and all recordings! The voice recordings and any recordings I've made on my phone and all my music have been stolen by Google play music and now I can't get them off or access them any other way.
Google Play Music,Ejeweubua Ogbolu,1,,"I was using this app in my previous phone, which is working perfectly ok. But i recently changed my phone to Nokia 3.1 it cant load my music . always shows ""no music available"""". please i need help."
Google Play Music,Ahmad Pirani,2,4,Sound quality is good. Horrible design. Very counter intuitive user experience. Very less tracks compared to other music streaming services. No wonder it is not popular.
Google Play Music,cotty j,1,1,This app crashes constantly. It plays for a few seconds then the app closes out completely. So ridiculous. Get your stuff together Google. Behave like you who still cares.
Google Play Music,Oona Reign,1,,Buggy! After 10 seconds of play the app shuts down! This is a new thing as it use to play perfectly. I have a subscription and have for years never having a playback issue.
Google Play Music,Courtney Giroud,2,4,"I updated this app the other day, and lost all my music on it, 400 something songs gone, and now it's telling me i need to subscribe again which I already was subscribe! So very angry."
Google Play Music,Brian Akermann,4,5,"When you looking at your library albums list, The right column of albums play button is to close to the scroll function. Basically you want to press play but end up scrolling to another location. Annoying."
Google Play Music,stealthysumo321,4,1,"Not much to complain about, plays your music and sorts it pretty well. My only gripe is it renames my songs, artists and puts random album covers on ( I am transferring music from my laptop to here). one feature I would love but isn't actually useful is a total music time in songs and total time for playlists. Another that would be useful, would be the ability to change album covers, titles and artists to fix errors yourself."
Google Play Music,Dillon Casteel,3,1,"Its pretty good, everything except for the ads making the song not play and skip all the good ones! Not bad for free. Just makes me think something wrong with my phone!"
Google Play Music,Radu Chetraru,3,,"It has some really weird bugs like the base not working always and also the player in the notification box can't be deleted sometimes and for that you have to play a song, scare yourself and then stop it, after all this finally you can delete the player"
Google Play Music,Shailen Sobhee,1,5,Song management is terribly poor with Google Music. You simply cannot list all songs by an artist. You can only see a small list of Top Songs. Google should really really improve their song management features.
Google Play Music,Steven Miller,1,,This app is garbage. why would I buy a subscription if I already purchased the song/songs? I should be able to download the song I purchase to my phone. How do I get a refund?
Google Play Music,jessica alicia,1,6,"felt cheated. it automatically took $12.99 out of my bank account and when I unsuscribe on the same day when they took my money, my subscription just ended without having NY money back! so pissed 🤬😡"
Google Play Music,Matt Lawson,3,3,been good for a year and lately been cutting out the audio. other apps work with sound but expect this one. need to fox bug. it has a great variety of big label artist and unsigned artist too.
Google Play Music,Queen Montes,1,1,"very useless,all the music i downloaded are not appearing on it at all,it is only the songs i receive through xender.i just feel like crying."
Google Play Music,James Houle,2,3,"Works well for the most part, please change the video ad to just audio at the start and I'll listen to it everytime because in the go i turn on the app and put it in my pocket. The app also at times displays the next song for about 5-10 sec and moves on to the next and respects that will again and again."
Google Play Music,A Google user,1,1,This app will not let you download the music that you paid for on a LG Stylo 4 phone that has 8.1.0 Android on it at all. It starts the download then it stop out of the blue.Let me know when you fix this bug and then i will give you five star's.Take care.
Google Play Music,Spencer Black,3,,"I'm having a problem where whenever I would add a new song, there would be a picture of an album on all of my songs, even if there isnt an album cover on that song. Can you please look into this problem?"
Google Play Music,John Bradley Jr,3,3,"I used to use this app years ago and then someone hacked into it and since then have nit been able to delete it or do anything but disable it , doing nothing . I believe it is a great app when I used it easy to navigate and save songs and playlists so dont be discouraged from my experience just use it right and it will amaze you ."
Google Play Music,Kassidy Sturn,1,1,"you close the app and it keeps playing. you have to open the app and wait for it to load before you can turn off the music, instead of an easy to use bar that stays locked at the top of the screen like Pandora or iHeartRadio"
Google Play Music,Rob W,2,3,It's great when it doesn't just stop working in Android Auto. Which happens frequently. will play for about 10 seconds and then just says Google play music isn't working right now. Have to uninstall and reinstall every time. Please fix this already! Considering Spotify instead.
Google Play Music,Aidan LaGraff,1,,"this is the worst music service ever. it randomly skips songs, skips over parts of songs, and is way too expensive to have this many problems. FIX YOUR SERVICE GOOGLE. IT SUCKS!"
Google Play Music,Buford Onstad,1,1,"You can buy music easily, but it sure seems to be a monumental thing for them to get the music into the library. I think I am going to have to go back to iTunes and sync my phone with it. Never had this problem with them."
Google Play Music,Sierra Danyow,1,1,I'm so pissed. All of my music is gone that I have had for years. Its like everything I have paid for is gone. I cant access any of my music. Definitely hate this app.
Google Play Music,Abhi Shek,2,2,The UI haven't changed much in the past 5 years..Why are you ignoring your own first party apps google... Thanks for the new features and functionality....but update the UI.
Google Play Music,Katalina Te Haate,3,6,I do like goggle play music but you pay but can't play many songs off line and some songs you like are only video. Am going though a lot more data because you have to keep it on if you want to listen to everything.

Google Play Music,Culumanco Mtyalela,1,5,App is rubbish honestly!! Keeps wanting me to subscribe when all I want to do is listen to my music. If I want to use it have to first uninstall and install it. Google you can do better!!! If there was an option to give it a zero star I would gladly give it such because it deserves it!!!
Google Play Music,A Google user,1,,This app don't work with my Philips BASS+ Supra (SHB3075) Bluetooth Headphones. I get the sound some what but it's very crapy sound.And my headphone works well with my low end cell phone's.Let me know when you fix this rude trash app.God bless Earth.

Google Play Music,Randeep Mann,2,,"The service and selection is pretty great but yhe inability to remove the ""swipe to delete songs feature"", makes the app a frustation time bomb. Unable to recall what song you remove, is very frustrating."
Google Play Music,lebowskii98 _,1,1,Purchased music is saved in an obscure place on the phone and files are named with random numbers instead of the track title. Can't see a way of changing either the file location or the naming of the files.
Google Play Music,wasif rana,1,1,"getting worse after continuous updates. appearence are changed . No longer become an app as an easy using music player rather than an online tools like gaana and jio saavan all that ..very upset as now the ""equializer"" is also vanished."
Google Play Music,Fred Hammonds,1,3,"horrible experience. Just do spotify, it's a much better platform. After learning a lot of the music I purchased is sung from regular people like you and me. I called customer support, and after Google Play Music admitted to the plagiarism they still refused in reimbursement."
Google Play Music,**********,1,5,"99/month is waste. If it is 10-20 rupees /month, then it is fine. Because in my case i used to play the songs very rarely, sometimes more than 2 months i will not use. So if i pay 99/month will go to bin. So single star"
Google Play Music,Randomized Gamerz,3,5,"the app is amazing but I am having problems with the app at least 4 times a week my music cuts off and I get am error message ""you are listening to music on another device"" even though I have no other device connected, just my phone. I have checked devices connected and just shows my phone I have refreshed the app too, so sadly I had to cancel my subscription and I will be moving to spotify in June. plus to say Bixby is Google based it doesn't like Google play music only spotify."
Google Play Music,Owen Walker,1,3,"Garbage! you have to ""subscribe"" to listen to your music and you have to pay to subscribe! This app used to be awesome now any other app would be better"

I have to click the play button over, and over, and over, and over again until my music plays. If I'm lucky, it plays first time, but until that's fixed, 4 stars."

Hungama,Harue Hanah,1,550,I installed this app a few months ago and I uninstalled it right after a few days of installation. After some time I was charged without my knowledge by hungama services. I tried to stop it but no use. I was charged many times without any reason. I want you to deactivate hungama service for good. It's very irresponsible on your part to do something like this. I have submitted complaints and got no reply. It's very infuriating to be charged for nothing.

Hungama,Rajendra Pratap Singh,5,19,"IS IT ANY GOOD? SIGHT WORDS HANGMAN is a straightforward, well-crafted word recognition practice game for new readers. The app developer indicates that it's particularly suitable for kindergarten and first-grade students as well as people learning the English language. As long as your kid isn't afraid of the rather spooky hangman image -- with big, beady black eyes and a bloated, blue body -- this game will be rewarding and fun. Sure, it's not expected that any game with a name like ""Hangman"" an"
Hungama,Nitin Sharma,3,,donot want to be critic but commenting based on my experiences. should be seen as an opportunity to improve. slow app. takes time to load pages even on wifi. it hangs some times. also ad pop ups (full screen) frustrate at times. its fine if ads are on a portion of screen.
