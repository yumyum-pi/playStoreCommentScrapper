Snowball.io,king squash,4,50,"It's a great game, but it makes it unfair when the other bots can make bigger snowballs faster than you if your both the same size, like in the beginning. It's still a great game other than that and the bugs. The only annoying bug for me is that sometimes when I win the game won't end even though everyone else is in the water and I can sit there forever but it still won't count as a win and give me points. It only happened to me 2 times so far so I'm not complaining just wanted you to know :)"
Snowball.io,sam yoonun,4,442,"The game is really awesome but there's a bug in the system though, everytime i try to play the game the bug kicks you out and it started kicking me out on the fourth round when you play and the only way i got rid of the bug is by uninstalling the game and reinstalling the game but the bug just kept getting me but overall i think the game is a 6 star game even though it only goes up to five. But i would like to see this bug get fixed and i hope this helps someone."
Snowball.io,Presley Ritchie,4,918,"This game is very entertaining! It's very simple to use and opperate. You can update different snow mobiles/skins very often! This game doesn't contain much ads at all, and if there is one, you can skip through it almost immediately! Great job designing this game. I'm so happy I downloaded it. This much great content for free? Can't believe it! I totally recommend this to anyone who loves fun, entertaining games/apps! Hope this review helps you understand what this game contains!"
Snowball.io,Tasnin taskia,3,45,"I like the game. Its fun and it is a game to relax in my opinion. But I recemend that as soon as the match is done, an advertisment comes and they are up to 30 secs, and it is the same add over and over again. But the game is fine . Just one request please put in shorter ads üòäüòä"
Snowball.io,Harvey Lennon,1,40,I HATE THIS GAME!!!!!every time I eliminate all the players I'm still in the arena try to go in the water I still don't die IT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN A TOURDAMENT!!!!and I had to watch an ad to restart all over again AND I WAS ON THE FINAL ROUND so because of this unfair stupid game I put 1 star but actually nought point 1billion I hate it so much they don't even fix glitches or bugs so whatever you do DONT INSTALL THIS GAME!!!!!
Snowball.io,Gameboy boy,3,9,"The reason I gave 3 stars is that there are lots of bugs! Like whenever I will be the only one remaining, it just doesn't give me stars and shows me 0th place! I have a screenshot of this but I don't know how to show. Please fix this bug."
Snowball.io,savage rob,5,343,"Ok, where to begin? The graphics? Amazing. The gameplay/controls? Astounding. The actual vehicles? Perfect. Love it. Can't think of any complaints. Edit. There's a bug that removes the death detection barrier, losing you experience points. Pls fix if possible. Still 5 stars."
Snowball.io,Simone Bair,4,1,"I like that I get to play with people around the world, and it's an online game the only problem that I have is sometimes in the middle of the game a glitches out but I still love it so much you should totally get this."
Snowball.io,Calhoun Family,4,14,"I like how easy it is to rank up. I'm currently Elite 4, and I'm enjoying the game. However, the ads after every. Single. Game. It's so tiring to waste 15 seconds after every one-minute match."
Snowball.io,Gamer Mike,5,9,This was awesome even though my progress reset when I reset my account to my youtube I easily made it up the ranks. Also I think you should add a general rank and it has a man with 2 snowballs in his hand.
Snowball.io,moon monkey 518,3,4,"Fun game, though I'm getting tired of these games that seem like their online (without outright saying it) but are just filled with bots."
Snowball.io,Darryl J. Palmer Jr.,3,11,"Every time I install it, it'll work fine for the first time. And when I open the app again, there's nothing but a black screen. My phone works perfectly itself so I know it's not that."
Snowball.io,Emma Welch,5,5,It's really easy to win games and it's easy to unlock new character designs. I like how you can change the colors of your character without having to watch a video or spend any money.
Snowball.io,Richard Houghton,3,,"I actually like the game but boring for offline would be good online, that and the add abuse is the only reason I've given 3 stars."
Snowball.io,Elisabeth Munger,4,103,"I really enjoy this game, but I wish that it was easier to join the same game as friends, and that it was easier to get from expert 3 to expert 4, and the rest of the ranks. Overall this game is fun, and I use it almost every day."
Snowball.io,Diego20202022,1,,I give 1 cus the game is broken why cus when I push the robot then it stop I been trying to get out when I fall in the water it doesn't kill me and I kill 2 robot I fall down and wait and wait but its broken what's why I give it 1star
Snowball.io,Janice Workman,3,21,It's good but the ads and I feel like I face BOTS. Graphics Controls and Gameplay are a 2-2 1/2. It's lags sometimes but it's good. Get it for a solid game. It
Snowball.io,Sans From Underman,1,26,Eh the game is very glitchy with bugs and game breaks everywhere and advertisements almost every time you win or lose. There is no real players there is just boys and bland maps. The game can be unfair a lot and ruin almost anything.
Snowball.io,King Ru1Z,3,,This game is pretty fun but when I won a game I had -1391 points I don't know how!? Please fix this bug thank you :D
Snowball.io,THE TIGER,4,80,"I love this game, it is good to play when your bored. However, way to many ads, it's getting annoying. I just want to enjoy the game instead of having an ad at the end of every match. Otherwise it is good."

Snowball.io,Gabmente,4,638,"This game is very simple, although it's simple it's pretty cool, it's like any other io game. First you start of on a island, with 8 other players, online, or not, depends is you have internet, and you fight to the death. It's kind of relaxing in a way. But, every good game has its doubts, I just think there should be new maps and skins. Keep the game interesting you know? But that's pretty much it from me, again very simple but cool game, and you should check it out. Good job! PS. Nice game!"

Snowball.io,Logan Fletcher,4,105,"I like this game, it's pretty fun, and the tournaments are pretty fun and competitive. The reason I give it four stars, is because sometimes it glitches and I can't win the game. It's like I'm the last one on the ice but it doesn't recognize that I'm the last one there, and when I go over the edge it recognizes that and ends the tournament. Or it will do the same thing, but when I go over the edge, it DOESN'T recognize that and I can go down forever. Also some new skins would be nice. Thanks."
Snowball.io,Maarne Olid,5,6,I like this game because of we can knock people off! Keep working!
Snowball.io,Tegan Rodger Patterson,4,487,"This game is very addictive! There are three suggestions I have, though. First, maybe you could tone down on the ads? Second, could you make a way so you can join friends or/and family in a game? Lastly, can you please not take my characters user name (Oof) and have the bots have it? I feel like I'm being watched. Thank you!"
Snowball.io,Melissa Quinonez,5,629,"Hi guys I just want to tell you that if you turn off data, wifi, or bluetooth, flashlight, portrait, battery saver, do not disturb, and cast, this will be different for iphone or other versions just turn off all your applications and only turn on arplaine mode, or just turn on arplaine mode then turn off your applications, then go to any game you want , then the ads won't come anymore.

Snowball.io,Brandon Davila,1,7,This game really sucks I think you should not play it because the controls don't even work they some times stop when ever I am still pushing it and sometimes it move back by itself which I don't get this game really sucks you should not play itüñïüñïüñï

Snowball.io,’º÷Öt…¶…®’º…¢  çatt…õ Äs,5,,Free premuim glitch go to buy it but dont buy it
Snowball.io,Xytrix TV,4,1,I only gave it 4 stars because i hope in thenext update there could be a multiplayer option that j can invite you friends
Hole.io,Mariangela Calatrava,4,231,"I really like this game, but it would be nice if they put new skins/challenges and new maps, because it's been the same for a long while. Now I don't play it so much, I have the ultimate rank and most of the skins. The only skin I haven't been able to win is the ""one for hole, hole for one""; I have no idea what I have to do to win it (so if you put new skins, make the challenge clear, please!)."
Hole.io,Flay Mingo,2,229,"The gameplay is good. Of all the .io games out there this one is the only one I genuinely enjoyed. But the only and biggest problem this game experience is the lack of game optimization in most devices. The game randomly crashes in the middle of the game (especially in the pirate-theme map), even without lagging. Additionally, the game uses so much resources that my phone heats up in just 7-10 mins of game play. I hope this issue will be fixed in the near future."
Hole.io,Dawn Bligh,4,416,I love the game. It's addictive. There are three modes and a lot of skins you can earn. The only thing stopping me from giving it five stars is that I wish it had a mode that times how long it takes you to eat everything on the any map. You could then try to beat your best time or simply destress by eating everything. I think that would be phenomenally popular. Thank you for creating the game.
Hole.io,Sari T Moore,5,1,"I like this game. I think it's based on a cartoon(black&White) about a Scientist who had a briefcase that carried a Portable Hole in it. Everybody was chasing him trying to get the breifcase(with the hole), but he was using the hole to hide from them because the hole had a lid. He would jump in the hole & pull the lid shut & his pursuers could not find him( they'd run over the lid not knowing it's a lid!)!"
Hole.io,Mandy Horton,4,522,"I do love the game, but, the problem I have with it is when trying to complete the ""eat the entire map in 2mins"" solo challenge, when the clock hits 1sec, it abruptly stops recording points. Even if I have buildings and items still falling in the hole, they dont go towards my percentage consumed. Which I don't think is right bc technically I've had it in the hole before the timer ran out. The the city world is impossible to completely consume in 2 mins bc there's so much to it! Add new worlds:)"
Hole.io,nat nat,5,685,this game is to fun and addictive I could literally play it all day. I love how there are a bunch of different skins that you can get. I have already got 7 and there are still plenty more. I would just prefer if you could play longer than 2 minutes for one game. But I'm not complaining this game is still amazing and definitely deserves 5 stars. this is a lot coming from me bcc I am very picky on games but this is my favourite
Hole.io,Maabena Webb,3,143,"This game is amazing and really fun, I could play for hours without getting tired. The only reason why I'm giving this game 3 stars instead of 5 is because there seems to be a bug that causes the game to close unexpectedly. I'll be in the middle of a game and the app will just close. This is very annoying and disrupts the gameplay. Please fix this. Thanks!"
Hole.io,Sycedrick Brown,3,35,"Could be a 5-star, if it wasn't for the constant need to reload the game, due to it hanging up on a ""loading..."" screen. Checked, and running the most current version. Maybe something to do with add-management, and might not be a problem if paid for ad-free version. Not worth investing at this time, just glitchy."
Hole.io,‚Ä¢Foxy Natasha‚Ä¢,3,84,Super nice game I really like it. But beacuse I give 3 stars is beacuse whenever you play a battle royale and you and a other hole are last. If you get to the maximum level of a hole and the other hole gets to the maximum level too you can't eat each other. And then it's a draw. So it's a little annoying. That's my only complain but the rest is great üòä
Hole.io,Camilla Dison,4,1019,I love the idea of this game. Extremely addicting. I only had two issues. One the game keeps freezing and two it needs more goals to pursue. If it had more goals that weren't so easy to achieve it would be more exciting. If a gamer can unlock every rank and skin within a week it doesn't keep said gamer engaged and they move into the next app. Thank you for the fun week.
Hole.io,Claire's Blogs!,5,740,"Really fun! I love all of the game modes. It's truly amazing, you can play hours nonstop! Although..... the game mode ""Solo Run"" Is a bit hard, usually it takes half of your time to get one size, and the require ment to win just seems unrealistic. Over all the game mode is really fun! The game classic is simple l, straightforward and overall really fun! My personal favorite game mode is battle! It's crazy how many hours I spent on that one game mode. Overall this is an amazing game!"
Hole.io,Erin Keim,3,120,"I actually LOVE this game, BUT while playing (especially during battle royale) my phone phone gets warm and even hot. Sometimes it gets so warm it causes my phone to go blank and I must do a hard reset. There are only 3 maps which are fun but more would definitely be more so. The ads aren't too bad so that's always a plus. If this game didn't make my phone hot and you had more maps, you'd get 5 stars."
Hole.io,J. Callaway-Pinckney,5,20,"This is such a fun game! It's a simple, easy, and great game for mindless entertainment. It definitely has its challenges to engage the player. Just enough to keep you playing, probably longer than you planned to lol. Definitely a wonderful recommend!"
Hole.io,Crystal Gates,5,86,It is amazing and I Soo addicting . I like how you only get 2minutes because then it's like a challenge and you have to be quick and eat the right stuff at first . Also I like how there's 3 modes and different skins and the cool maps . My favorite map is the future one with the robots . My favorite skin is the shark skins . My favorite mode is the be the last sat hole left . Thank you for making this game and ilysm ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hole.io,Nikki E,5,45,"Very fun gobbling up everything. Not always easy to do. I've now maxed out on how high my ranking can be AND I have gobbled up 95.1% of an eat everything game. My best score! Very, very fun. 04/18/20: I have maxed up my awards & can't rise any higher. My eat everything best is 95.1 still. I wish they would add more worlds to eat & more levels to conquer. It's now me trying to beat my own best score. Good game. Being home 24/7 has me wanting to eat stuff not food. Developers, add more please!!!!!"
Hole.io,Sushi Beast,5,1138,"I love the game, (my user is Death Trap, so just letting you know) you can play offline, and in multiple modes. I love the different skins and the gameplay. Good for all ages but can sometimes be stressful. You don't need to purchase anything to make the game enjoyable. I wish that there were coins and that you could buy skins, but it's another masterpiece from Voodo!"
Hole.io,Toren Christensen,1,35,"This game is a scam! They use bots (AI controlled things), not real players. I know because I can play entire rounds in airplane mode, or turn airplane mode on halfway through and continue playing. Also, I win almost every time, and I've only had the game for about a week. Everywhere online- Wikipedia and Reddit say it uses bots. Their website lies and says they don't use bots. What a scam! Uninstall this game until they make it with real people, not bots. I'll uninstall it."
Hole.io,Han,3,27,"Other ""players"" are quite obviously Ai's which makes it a bit less fun. Also have maxed out several times on classic but no reward to unlock the skin for this achievement. On battle royale if you and the the other remaining player reach level 19 it's a stalemate and no way to leave the game other than to close and relaunch. Really good concept and very addictive but could do with some work."
Hole.io,KB MILLER,5,17,"Ok here is an Honest Review the game is fun as per the others complaining about 99 cents go back to the good will pop some tags it's a game Sheesh as per the game itself? you can only if you figure it out, beat ALL the Maps, Kudos Creator on the way you set it up so it can be beat this is an edit of my original post saying only 1 map could be beat üòâ I own up to my mistakes can't wait for more Maps. THANKS For Good Game. Time is the keyüòâüëçüëç"
Hole.io,Brian Healey,3,,"Very cool game, slows down a bit sometimes and won't let me complete classic game before crashing! And sensitivity on my steering screws up all the time it'll keep going forward without me wanting it to and won't turn. Wish I could fix those glitches cuz I do like the game!"
Hole.io,McKayla Kim,5,686,YAAASSS!!!!!!! I love this game! It calms me down. 1. It kinda makes u hungry üòã And I love being hungry for some reason üòÇ 2. It helps me for example if u get hurt by someone you can play this and this makes you believe you can stand up to him/her 3. It just brings me joy! 4. It makes me feeling like I can do anything. So if your doing something you are afraid to do just play this game and it might help! Thank you for reading meh! PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!! THANK U
Hole.io,Maecyn Watson,4,346,"Awesome game. Four stars because when i'm playing the game mode where u eat your enemies until there's just you left, one time i got as big as i could get, and so did the one other person that was left, and we couldn't eat each other bc we were the same size, and there was no way to leave the game, so i had to close the app and get back on. I wish you could just keep getting bigger. Please let us get bigger. You can only go up to 19. So yeah, otherwise, it's great. Thank you for this game!!!!!!!"
Hole.io,A Google user,1,112,"So good ! But you could stop having to much ads because when I was playing it stopped for an ad ,and most of the time when I lose the game an ad pops up so please stop putting so much ads .I deleted Hole.io because there are to many ads and who wants a game that has ads every second it is really annoying .Another thing is that if you buy something and uninstall the game you have to buy it again and also it requires internet which can get annoying .This was My honest review . This is bad."
Hole.io,Gita Karki,1,4,"I haven't given any bad reviews to any game.This is the first game. 1. My phone hangs a lot when I play this game. 2.It takes a lot time to open 3When I am taking it to another direction it itself goes to another direction So,in my opinion this is the worst game by Voodoo.Please develop it"
Hole.io,Angel Baker,5,13,"I somehow became addicted to this game... I'd love more board options though and bigger sink holes so I can actually eat 100% boarding. Great game though and I highly recommend it to anyone.... Still need more board designs to play instead of the same three... Hello, MORE BOARDS... PLEASE??"
Hole.io,A Simpson,4,193,"I really like the resolution improvement; the graphics are nice and crisp. It's a fun game, the concept is great, but it needs expansion. Perhaps boosters than can be collected to increase the time? I play the solo, percentage game and it's impossible to finish the pirate and future maps in 2 minutes. Time boosters could make it possible to finish these maps and would add some strategy to the game."
Hole.io,Leah Patricio,4,320,"I don't like this game... I LOVE IT. I find it an amazing game if your bored and need something to do. You can play offline which is fantastic if you are constantly out and can't connect to a hot spot or Wi-Fi. I find it interesting and satisfying how everything is put together. I would rate this overall a four because of some horrifying problems that have occurred to me. I want everyone of you to know the problems, one, it has WAY to many adds and secondly it glitches and I wish it didn't."
Hole.io,Heba Hejji,4,123,"I really like this game and it's the best game in the world but i only have 2 thing i dont like about the game, first the time is too short and i think you should like do the time a little longer i will really appreciate it and the second thing is that after every round you always get an add and thats just wasting time but i really like the game and like you could spend hours playing it and never get bored wow üò±üòç"
Hole.io,The Real Carolina Queen,5,354,I actually really enjoy this game. It's not too difficult but oddly satisfying. It's nice to be good at a game but with relative ease but still exciting. Like if another player is trying to eat you there is a definitely a little rush trying to get away. The skins are cool and broad choices which I like. I can be a pretty rainbow one time and then a zombie the next. I reccomend for sure.
Hole.io,Ashley Jones,3,124,"The game is so much fun but several things can make it better. 1. It's impossible to eat the whole board in 2 mins. 2. Ive maxed out in size several times(not that the game tells you) and haven't been rewarded. 3. The island is the worse board, you start out too small to eat anything. 4. Somehow in the very beginning of the game some holes start out significantly bigger than others. 5. Lastly, it would be nice if the different skins had different benefits. I love your game, please fix these."
Hole.io,Scott Leipprandt,1,142,Completely overrun with excessive advertisements that trick you into clicking on them to download more ad-filled apps. The ads end up taking up more screen time than playing the game itself! This is in addition to the ad that is constantly on the bottom of your screen the entire time the app is open and in addition to the ad that shows up in the main menu. The game would be decent if not for all of the advertisements so I am uninstalling.
Hole.io,Jorge Rodriguez,1,33,"It's the worst game I've ever seen, the graphics are horrible since they're covered up with ads, the controls are horrible, and the constant advertisement s popping up on my phone is awful, and just so you know these aren't even real people they're just AI's you can tell from how they play they're horrible names that they've made up and it doesn't even lag so really all in all if this is what entertainment is for people then I think we should just give up on making games"
Hole.io,Jemini Day,4,,"Even though this is fun, I really really wish there was an untimed version where there's no time limit, just see how long it takes to devour it all, which could be used as a compete against yourself to beat your own time record."
Hole.io,Jessica Meek,4,152,"Battle Royale mode glitches to the point where no one wins. You get to level 19 and that's the highest you can get. If you haven't beaten everyone by then, you're in a perpetual stalemate with the computer. The only way out is to exit the game. Also, the pig skin is impossible to get. You have to reach max size in normal mode 3 times, just past 2k points. I've done this several times, and the counter still says 0/3. I'm not paying a dollar for a glitch. Glitchy but a good time waster."
Hole.io,Berlin's Draws,3,108,"It's a GREAT game, but it needs a bit of work. The death match game mode never seems to work right, one time the last two people being stuck at lvl 19 and then the other 'person' litched out of the map. Then it always seems to lag, and then stop working and clise the app. It was a pretty goid game overall, just needs a few tweaks here and there is all."
Hole.io,riqui lugo,1,75,I paid for no adds a while ago because the game was fun and the adds are annoying. So my phone broke and I got a new one. In the corner where it says no ads it has the little circle with a slash through it. So I should have no ads. But as I play with this new phone it sneeks in the ads here and there. I will finish up with a round and there will be an advertisement after it. Sometimes there's an ad on the bottom when I'm playing. I paid for no ads I expect no ads at all. Fix this please.
Hole.io,Donna Dickinson,3,2,"The game was ok but there are 2 things that I have to complain about, 1 the game is really hard to play on computer and the other thing is that when you play it on a computer not only is it hard to play but it is the size of a phone not the whole screen but it is ok. please can you make it so it is the size of the whole screen and can you make it easyer to play on the computer by using the arrow up down left and right. Thank you!"
Hole.io,Dan Strike,1,78,"It's just an ad platform. Ads on screen 100% of the time, plus a 15-30 second ad after every 2-minute game. No sound, at all, except for the ads. Very poor performance. Feels like 15fps on a phone that runs Asphalt 8/9 smoothly. A shame because the concept is fun but implemented with ad revenue in mind only. Avoid."
Hole.io,Chase Stanley,4,1,"Keeps crashing. I paid to remove ads and i still have ads even after restarting and syncing my purchases multiple times Edit: deleted cache and data and it's working fine, only get ads when i opt for a bonus round. I wish there were people to play with online, rather than AI"
Hole.io,DeeDee Romero,5,156,"My 'go to' game to pass the time! Nice short games of 2 min and cool skins you can earn for FREE! The Ads are not terrible.I play this game every day! A very fun game! At first I thought I was playing with real people, but the other players are bots. Out of all the games I have downloaded, Hole.io ...is the only game I have kept on my phone the last 2 years. I delete all others after I tire of them. Just because of this reason this game deserves 5 stars!"
Hole.io,Wesley Howington,4,586,"Its a great game all and all. But i have been playing and mulitiple times i have been on level 19, and the 1 other player was on level 19 too. We couldnt eat each other, and i eventually had to back out of the game. Would really like it if the creator could fix that. But over all its a good game, very challenging, and fun at the same time."
Hole.io,Jai Pleasant,3,328,"It's fine but it needs more challenges, more levels, more achievements and prizes. The whole concept with the game is fun but it is very short-lived after you realize you're playing the same levels over and over again which is like four to five stages. This game should also have a chat room so players can talk to each other thus creating teams, games and championships. Are we really playing real people online?"
Hole.io,Ivory Tim,5,109,"Hole.io is one of the best games ever. It keeps me occupied and it is loads of fun! I highly recommend downloading this game and while your at it give it a 5 star review. This game is fun and time consuming for all ages. It is fun and exciting to collect each and every cool skin! It is challenging but not to hard to get first place and beat you opponents. Hole.io is the best game to play if you are looking for interest, entertaining, and fun."
Hole.io,Magick Miiror,4,2,"Good time passer, very addictive. The ads aren't overbearing which is really nice. My only complaint is more maps and either better AIs or ability to play with real players. It's gets a little boring when I'm the only giant hole with 2,500+ pts every round and others are tiny specks that barely get over 100pts."
Hole.io,Shellz,2,142,"You know why I gave you two stars? Sure, I've had fun playing this game but your company is shady as heck when it comes to this app. I've been playing for months now and not once have you fixed the problem involving where you have to get your circle the max size time 3 times in order to get a certain skin. That progress bar never fills up. Instead, you slap a 99 cent tag on it, relying on those determine to collect all the skins. That's just cruel You should be ashamed but you aren't"
Hole.io,emily torres,4,,"This game is awesome there is 3 modes and those are classic, Solo Run and Battle! The reason why I rated this as 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think there are way to much adds. If you guys fix this then I'll rate this as a 5 star rating."
Hole.io,Nina Beake,2,15,Very laggy. Whenever I finish a game I have to pick an advert which is really annoying. The game also crashes every 15 minutes which is also really annoying. for it to get 4 stars it would have stop it's lagging and crashing big time. But overall it's a really satisfying game.
Hole.io,Nuevo proyecto,2,84,This game is fun and entertaining. But I have one issue. Every time I play any mode the app freezes and logs me out of it. This has been happening constantly. It glitches a lot. And give more time because it makes it impossible to achieve all achievements. Once that's fix I'll give 5 stars. I have been playing this for a lo g time and never did this till now. FIX IT!!!
Hole.io,Jonathan Hudgins,1,123,"This game tries to present itself as an online multiplayer game in its description, but after a short time playing it's very easy to tell that's not true. All of the other ""players"" are clearly bots, and it took very little time to advance past their skill level. Always check category listings before downloading something, as this one is clearly categorized as ""single player"" by the Google play store."
Hole.io,darkie the cat :3,4,254,It's good and actually helps time go a bit slower for me but i literally got 2344 as my best score but it still hasn't triggered the max size .What the hell is this glitch? It doesn't bother me that much but you must be saying 'why are you writing about it?' Because it's a bug and you need to fix or you need to state the exact points for max size
Hole.io,Cosmic Karma,1,1,So many people have had issues with getting Pig skin. Seems android users have a bug that wont allow MAX size. It's been like this for a year. It needs to be fixed. Unfortunately the developer wont listen or pay attention.
Hole.io,Maria Fouad,4,2,"It's a nice game, but it's just that it has no goals you just play if you you get some stars, which are useless. The game will be much better if you add some goals. And did I mention that the people I'm against are not real. I played the game for 5 days and then I uninstalled it."
Hole.io,Seth Milano,2,445,"I was wondering why I always win, and then I realized this game is NOT ONLINE. This game is made entirely of bots. Put your phone in airplane mode, turn off WiFi and data, and yet the app will still put you in-game. All the bot ""usernames"" are reused. The bots run straight into your mouth if you stand still. Would be cool if it was actually an online battle-royale."
Hole.io,Steve Mattison,1,29,"Obvious bugs, pixelated glitchy graphics, unlockables that don't unlock, and controls that leave something to be desired. It's obvious the developers have abandoned this game. Multiple players reach level 19 and neither can eat the other. The first to 19 isn't awarded the win, neither is awarded the tie, and no controls are provided to quit the game. And the player is never awarded the unlockable for reaching the max level 3 times. What gives!"
Hole.io,Samuel Oliver,3,15,"Good fun game, but a basic key improvement would be to have a high score for each of the maps as they play very differently! It them allows you to enjoy playing some of the harder maps to beat your high score. Instead you are just Trying to beat a high score for the easiest map on the hardest map!"
Hole.io,Jacquelyn Marie,3,9,"I have played battle, once your at level 19 w the crown, you can't eat the other player if they're at level 19. Stupid. You just run around eating stuff for no reason. Another thing, I was rewarded the bunny skin for eating a spider, the last thing I needed.. guess what? Never got the skin. Plus you can get as big as possible and never ever work your way up to get the pig skin. Basically just to make you buy stuff. Fix this stuff. It's not enjoyable when you try and don't get the stuff."
Hole.io,brenda egenhoff,3,9,Its a really fun game and great time killer but there are too many ads!!! At the end of the level it gives an option to watch an ad for a bonus and if you hit no thanks it gives you an ad to watch anyways!!! Might as well watch the bonus ad i guess because there really ia no choice. Ads for everyone
Hole.io,A Google user,3,,"It a cool app and helps pass time the only problems are the ads it's not as bad as most apps where you can't even touch the screen without getting an ad shoved in your face, but I would definitely enjoy the app more if they didnt give so many apps other that that great app V‚óè·¥•‚óèV"
Hole.io,amber lander,1,2,"Game is horrible it has very very slow loading times, and often takes a couple minutes to load into a game. It is very laggy when I got on, for half the time I was stuck there frozen, you don't barely even have enough time to finish everything, very annoying 1 star."
Hole.io,Guilherme Doherty Marques,3,3,Nice graphics and gameplay but a few kinks to fix. A couple bugs prevent from unlocking some skins and needs to have max size increased to make solo run possible. Will check it again in a couple months and update the review accordingly. Has potential.
Hole.io,Kris Chudawala,1,13,End up having to quit the game every time in Battle Royale mode. When you reach level 19 and the only remaining bot/player is also on level 19.... there is no way to win either for you or them.... and then the only way is for me to quit the game therefore losing the points anyway. Please fix this bug.
Hole.io,Ivana Aguilar,5,,"This is the best game ever because when you play the game more you will get a level that would not show the hole's because that is the practice level. And it gives 2 minutes to eat a lot of the stuff in the game like building's,car's,and people."
Hole.io,thomas briem,3,62,This game is fun but reaching max size is impossible. Completing the entire map in solo mode is a joke. It'll place you next to nothing small enough to grow so you waste your first minute of the two just trying to grow in general. When you get big enough to eat the huge buildings you run out of time or the app crashes. You can't upgrade your hole to move faster or grow faster either so I'm not very sure how the goals are to ever be reached. Add in game currency and upgrades. I'll give 5 stars.
Hole.io,Ashleigh Kuhns,4,25,"Love playing, but don't like how I can't get the pig skin. Also, in battle royale, I have on a couple of occasions gotten down to the last 2 players at level 19 and neither are able to eat each other so we just continue to eat the world until someone exits the game completely."
Hole.io,Umair Shaikh,5,19,"I love this game , but I think that the time limit should be more like 3 minutes and there are no more issues this game is the best and I suggest that everyone should try this game and quote their opinions and I hope they make more games of these types!!!"
Hole.io,SAgamesYT noice,5,,This game means better instructions on how to get to specific things. For example the Quest kind of stuff that at the bottom maybe like say put it as a game mode and say what level you need to be to actually do it you know?
Hole.io,Stacie,3,58,"Definitely could be better. The game will just start to lag and close itself for no reason and it's become so frequent that I can't even finish one game. Before this started, I loved this game and my son and I would challenge each other allll the time. Now, it's just an inconvenience and disappointment."
Hole.io,Simon√© Searle,5,72,"Its a very cool game, I absolutely love it! The only problem I have now is that I played it for so long there isn't much more I can do in the game. I know all the maps like the back of my hand and there are no new places to play on. I would like to suggest maybe adding a bit more stuff to do to the game? I would really enjoy that! The gameplay is really addicting and the controls are not to bad, all in all a really great game!"
Hole.io,Alexzandria Moler,4,3,"It's a good app. It has a perfect amount of ads. Not to many,not to little. But it gets kinda boring, please make it have multiple games to play that would make 5 stars! Thank you for making this app!"
Hole.io,Annalise Plewa,3,31,"The game is really fun, but, when playing battle royale mode, you max out at level 19 and if your opponent is at level 19 too, the game is stuck. Also, you earn stars to level up but once you reach a certain level you can't level up any more. I just feel like after a while you get stuck in the same place."
Hole.io,Chris Felsh,3,224,"Terrible ads. This game used to be very little ads, I understand it from a business perspective but this has turned into a simply money hungry game. There are ads repeatedly and even if you watch an ad right after a game to get rewards you watch another ad before you start another game. This game used to be top tier, now it's a mediocre pile of rubbish."
Hole.io,eunice almira dela cruz,5,20,I love the game! It really is a great game for me maybe other's won't like it or some will. I appreciate this game because sometimes you dont really need to win you just need to know how fun it can be maybe for others they really want to win. I just played this for maybe 2 months and it was a great experience. üòä
Hole.io,Ella Kidder,4,13,I like Hole io. . There is one world that is don't like and that is the futuristic world . My favorite world in the pirate world . The game controls are really easy to use. I feel like there could be more worlds like a dinosaur world. But otherwise the game is real creative and really good. The skins are really creative and fun .
Hole.io,BlazE,4,5,"Hole.io is a fun game to play, and it is a good game to come looking for if you are bored with your other games, or if you are looking for a new game to beat. I did find that it took a while to install, but the gameplay is good. It did take a while to beat, but it wasn't as long as I expected it to last. I think that if the game was a little longer, then it would be a better experience, but other than that, everything else was pretty good. I would totally recommend this game to anyone."
Hole.io,Cole Winters,4,1,"Good but survival mode is broken, once you get to max size if the other person is also max size nobody wins. Please do something about this. Also there are only 4 levels here but there are lots more on the web version why arent they on this app too?"
Hole.io,Tim Donk,5,7,"Great time killer. Only complaint ""No thanks you"" (fixed) Wish there was an option that allows you to clear the map with unlimited time, allowing you to shoot for a best time. Need to be able to choose map to play."
Hole.io,Cattown0w0 - the land of da foo,4,172,"Really fun and satisfying game, but extremely laggy and a bit unfair. About the lag bit, everytime I move, it freezes my screen, then it crashes (sometimes). And its unfair at the start of the game because they made the holes way too small (at least, with the skin I'm using) making it impossible to capture anything. In the end of one game, I had only 1 point while the rest had literally hundreds! Its pretty addictive when its cooperating tho..."
Hole.io,Noahboy !,1,94,"1, It's not actually online. 2, You can't get bigger than level 19, so if multiple holes reach it, it's stalemate. 3, It constantly crashes. 4, No sound. 5, If you stand still, the bots will just run into your mouth. (If your bigger.) 6, The proportions of the environment are way off. 7, Even if you tap the ""No Thanks"" button when it asks if you want to watch an ad to double your points, it will show you an ad. 8, it glitches out constantly. 9, The logo for this game is an icon from Portal."
Hole.io,subrahmanyam vinjamuri,4,4,"Hi, i would like to show a bug. In the ""Be the last hole"" mode, once any two or more reach level 19, it is impossible to eat other hole/s. No matter how many items i eat, I'm not able to eat other hole and its stuck right there unless close the app. Please fix this bug."
Hole.io,Amy Riley,2,69,"Game is ok. Major bugs won't let me get to Max size even though I have 2800+ score. Can't get past level 19 in the last hole standing. Maps are boring and need more of a challenge. Treasure mode was fun, but only showed up once the whole time I've played the game and I'm already maxed out my levels. Game is fun at first but the developers don't seem to care about fixing the bugs."
Hole.io,Andrew Polland,2,85,"Very disappointed that paying to remove Ads does not remove the Ads from the bonus game. There is also a glitch where if you get to level 19 with another player on battle royale then you're just stuck and the game never ends. Also not convinced this is multiplayer, it's very easy to win and the other players actions seem quite odd like they're robots. Fun game, but probably best staying away from."
Hole.io,Kaylee Keo,5,3,I have no words how incredible this game is. It's a time killer and effective. Great game play. Everything is sucky in 2020 but game apps are the only good thing happening. This one is part of the good thing in 2020
Hole.io,Serena Ross-Batty,3,71,I really like this game and so does my sister but it is quite annoying when this thing pop up in the top of the screen and it's also very blotchy so every time I try to get rid of this thing it keeps going into my settings. Also there are quite a few adverts. It would make this game a lot better if there weren't any glitches. And if there were no glitches I would rate it a 4.
Hole.io,Amber DeClue,3,,"I'd give more stars, but it constantly freezes and kicks off. Which is extremely irritating, but on good note it's a fun game. Silly, but fun. And can you make the hole go faster by chance?"
Hole.io,Chanikant Boonma,3,,The Adkins are very easy to get I think the challenges should be more challenging and also the game is very easy I like games that are hard so it would take me hours and years to finish and I would be notice but overall the game was amazing and fun.
Hole.io,Denise Rogers,1,5,It's broken..so disappointed! The ads come up and nothing is there and it hangs up. Also I reinstalled and it disnt save anything. Not worth playing to gain other stuff since u just lose it all if the game breaks. And after reinstall it's still broken and randomly crashing.
Hole.io,The Asenso Fam: Gaming of 4,4,,First what I gotta say is that it's good that it doesn't have ads. But the worse it that THE MAPS always the same so the robotic theme I think goes for me like 2 times and why dobt we have challenges with pros at the game? PLEASE FIX THE GAME
Hole.io,Sfreeman7121,4,8,I love this game! Although I wish we could adjust the time and there was some sort of backround noise. And maybe prizes and boosters or something. But I love the concept. Iv had this game forever! 4/18/2020 Game is currently crashing. Was fine after last update until I tried to battle. Now it crashes no matter what
Hole.io,Martin Brightman,1,130,"DO NOT INSTALL! Hole.io seemed like a great game and the reviews were pretty good as well. However the hole is quite hard to control, you have to stay still if you want to eat anything which is time consuming. Also after about 1 minute into the game the hole will get stuck in one direction, and won't stop going in that direction until it reaches the barrier and gets stuck. Therefore you cannot eat anything while the hole is stuck. Overall, it is very hard to eat things and also very glitchy."
Hole.io,Melquiades,3,105,"Awesome game, but... Scope for improvement, devs: 1. Fix the Battle Royale bug. Last 2 players can never eat each other (level 19, FYI). 2.Put in landscape orientation, guys, there'll be more room for dragging our finger around. 3. We'd LOVE a multiplayer mode, like an ACTUAL Battle Royale. 4. Also, we'll keep internet on in that case, so you can advertise to your heat's content. ( Pro tip: Please don't do that.)"
Hole.io,M Johnson,5,10,Can't stop playing...one of the most fun games ever!!!!üòÅ Really enjoy the many different players you get to challenge yourself with to win. Awesome...give it a try...you might fall prey or eat everything and be the winnerü§©üí• Good day and have fun!!!!
Hole.io,Linda Chism,4,4,Love this game. Very simple very addictive. It's very satisfying eating everything in sight. I only wish there were power ups that would give you more time or make you faster. 2 mins goes by too fast and it seems when you get bigger the hole slows down. Other than that I would give it a 5!
Hole.io,s p,4,8,"This is so fun, I absolutely LOVE it! I only wish you could play online, but other than that it's a 10/10 app! I love swallowing the buildings and tiny things, it's one of the most satisfying things ever. Voodoo, I absolutely LOVE your apps! (This is my mom's phone qwq) ~Fluffy :>"
Hole.io,Shawn Fannin,2,22,"Download this game again in hopes that the issues were fixed... they have not been game is still leggy, locks up, poor touch control and has no proper exit always have to hit the home button. I like this game I just wish they would fix it. With all the ads you have to watch I expect something a little better."
Hole.io,Gourang Kumar,2,14,Awesome game but.. the max size is glitched. I regularly hit 2000+ but I don't get any progress done on the skin requiring max size 3 times. I searched up the max size and it says 1250+. Please fix this as I'm unable to get that skin. Also it would be great if you could add something to link your account's progress and purchases.
Hole.io,Sonja Standish,4,39,"I loved this game but it keeps kicking me out of the app mid-game. I haven't played since it had just the one game mode. I was excited to see the other two modes but then I kept getting kicked out of the app, and now I'm no longer excited to play. I really do hope this gets fixed! *not happening anymore, still enjoying the game."
Hole.io,Coach,1,71,"You can tell the developers have no clue who they sell advertising to and what they are doing to their own game. They have an app that Every. Single. Time that the ad runs the game locks up and causes you to log out and restart the game. That's a lot of fun. Try reviewing your game and not your bank account, you might make more money. Don't download this game there is enough others that are just as fun and don't lock up. This is coming from a player that has every badge and used to love this one"
Hole.io,Shakuntala Pawar,5,42,"It's an awesome game üòé.The various modes and options make it a lot fun .It is not that addictive yet is a lot fun .Once you get engrossed it is hard keeping the phone For the people who complaint about bugs and adds ,you know this is a way of sponsoring .And if more problem u can turn the data of"
Hole.io,jonghan kim,5,10,"Highly recommend this game if you're looking for something to keep you busy. l especially like ""VOODOO"" games, but this is probably one of my favorites. Awesome game. 5 stars. The graphics and quality are great, and the good thing is you can play anytime, anywhere because it doesn't need Wi- fi."
Hole.io,Nancy Dittmer,5,,I love this game NOTHING OF THE BAD STUFF THAT OTHER PPL SAID ARE TRUE!!!! This game some times helps me and my dad and my cousin when we are upset or mad also it's just a fun game that needs no WI-FI or internet IDK witch one it needs.... But it's fun and I can play any ware!!! With out using the hot spot thingy!!!!! Edit: eh heh after down loading on my grandmas tablet(on it now)its not working I HATE THE WYFI IN THE CONTRY!!!$!!!!!!!!
Hole.io,RoBlocks YT,3,10,"Turned on airplane mode and was still playing with 'players', so I decided to play with airplane mode on and play with no ads, the game is very addictive. But I wanted the concept given a little more justice when coming In game format, it had really big potential."
Hole.io,M langkau,4,,I believe this is a very very fun game but it can get boring pretty quick so I suggest this is more of a game just to fill in times where you're waiting for something or waiting for someone for only 5 or 10 minutes DO
Hole.io,Philip Kowalski,4,14,"Very different concept of game play. Kinda bored of only 3 game fields, but the ads are far fewer than on most other ""free"" games. The developers struck a good balance on this one. I play it every day, mainly because I'm on the game field.......not watching ads."
Hole.io,Donna Holland,1,13,"If I could've given it zero stars I would have. There are only 3 maps that switch around and 3 game modes. There is also a glitch or error in the skins as you cannot get the pig without purchase. Ads pop up randomly within the actual play. Please fix these issues, so we can enjoy playing again. Thanks."
Hole.io,Atul Bharat,5,11,"It's a fantastic game I love all voodoo games but hole .io is the best you can do many things in this game like capture the animals and eat it in this game we can eat buildings ,cars,trees and many things you can eat other holes also and you can be bigger by eating them. They give challenges to you to solve . It's a good game play it and rate this app"
Hole.io,Arce Lozano,4,1,It's a great game! Although I did pay for no ads and it's really annoying that if I want to play a bonus level its still shows me a 30 second ad that I can't opt out of.
Hole.io,Viviana Apolinar,1,,The game is fun but it lags all the time. Closes out of nowhere and when you try to move sometimes it doesnt move right away so you lose time and it starts to glitch so I don't really recommend
Hole.io,Vian May,4,2,"2020 update: the percentage goals are still impossible, but it's a game I keep coming back to. Feb 2019: wow i used to love this game but the January 18 2019 update ruined it (went from 5 stars, down to 2, tried playing it again, dropped it down to 1 star)"
Hole.io,Michael Edwards,2,64,Fun game to play but there are a lot of glitches. In the Battle mode competitors end up stuck off the map so you can't win. Multiple play end up at level 19 and you can't win. The green character respawns when it should not. Nothing telling you what leveling up does for you. Are any of the earned holes better than the others (stats?).
Hole.io,Robert Drake,3,6,Great game. Lots of fun. But it would be nice to be able to extend the time during solo with flashing animals people etc. Vary its size at random. Make the controls better. The hole slows for no reason and even stops for no reason.
Hole.io,Chris,2,3,"Fun game, but you only play against bots. I don't think I've ever had an online game. I want to play people, not bots, they are boring. Please reduce how annoying the adwall is, or reduce the price too remove the ads, as this ruins the ecosystems of the game"
Hole.io,Kylie UzU,2,,Not the best i expected. I was hoping it would be like paper.io2 where you can move your finger and actually steer instead of making the hole move if you get what im saying. Its also super glitchy so i can barley even move to get stuff. I can only get 5-10 points for each match i play. I dont recommend this game.
Hole.io,Reynaldo Rodriguez,3,34,"Fun casual game, but it has some issue. After a few mins I liked it enough to pay to remove the ads, but somehow some game mods like Treasure Hunting and Wheel of Rewards are only available after watching ads (infuriating). Also as other reviewers mentioned, you can get stuck on Battle Royale mod if the last players reach Lvl 19, which is the limit and are unable to eat each other."
Hole.io,Wayne Sturge,2,13,Before i rated this app 4 stars but this game has sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many glitches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I Ioveeeee this game but THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i really hope you can fix this cuz it also makes my entire phone glitch.
Hole.io,Tad Arnold,4,3,"I really love this game, (my username is Slurp) but my only problem is that if you reach the max level (19) you can't eat the other player if they are level 19 as well. This game would also be a lot better with music."
Hole.io,Laura Penney,4,1,It's a good game and I recommend it but it lags and it gets stuck. Also you have to buy different skins (with REAL money). It always logs you out when your on a high level. We dis-downloaded it and downloaded it again and it STILL got stuck!!
Hole.io,Joel Fernandez,3,47,"Its a really fun game, I would love to give it a 5 star, but it keeps logging me out everytime I want to play. There is a glitch in the game. Also try to add more minutes to the game, its impossible in 2 minutes to eat a city, more minutes means more fun and challenging.. Please fix, thank you."
Hole.io,Jack Stevenson,1,45,"Terrible game. Its VERY CLEARLY offline as the names are fake and the movement is Generic. But not just that. When you're the only ACTUAL PERSON, you get targeted. I played 2 games and got targeted by 4 in one and 3 in the other. Ridiculous. And the whole company just wants money. They litter everything with ads, even the desktop ACTUAL ONLINE version. Stupid, if you want your time to be well spent don't install"
Hole.io,Stacey Spears,5,2,"Love playing Hole.io!! I enjoy the solo game, but it would also be nice to have another game choice. I would also like to be able to clear all the board with no time limit."
Hole.io,gerardo gomez,1,1,"Please fix it! The game keeps closing out less than a minute after you start a round. I have this game on my phone and tablet, please fix what is still an awesome game."
Hole.io,karl brook,3,6,"Really slow to move, ads are overwhelming, the objects don't fall fast enough and their could be an extra 20 seconds easy the map is always half full due to slow starts. Could be miles better, also I've lost all my game progress, no option to sign in or change graphics I'm on a s7."
Hole.io,Drew Gwenus Prime,5,8,"Realy Cool!,as you play you get more skins by getting your rank higher or finishing the quest but in another way you can pay for it.Offline game too,it is really entertaining to my eye.Its a bit suprising some players are actually NPC's i found put by finding a glitch my hole looks really still until a hole just inserts itself on my holeüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
Hole.io,Cheesy Andawsome,3,3,"The game is good, but ads really sucks! I waited so long to get back to the menu bc of ads, like there's no responses. I have to force close and back to the game. Hope this game will fix this issue soon.."
Hole.io,Levias Wolfe,5,,Wildly addictive! I love playing this when I have the time. It is addictive to see how much of a city or land you can get swallowed up! It is a challenge for sure!
Hole.io,Nurul I,1,6,"Everytime i reach lv 19 in battle royale, i just cant eat the other player, or they cant eat me, so those last two players are just stuck, no ending, like glitching, and the level dont increase either, so i have to force ending the app Edit. Now, everytiem i play for 5 seconds, the app close itself."
Hole.io,Dr Redz,4,11,Pretty cool game I like it but my only 2 problems are that when you try to eat stuff you can't move whilst eating it you have to stay still also the ADS!!! They are s√≤ooo annoying every time you finish a game IT happens an ad ad ad ad and so on but overall when you have no problems it's pretty cool.
Hole.io,Billy Haynes,1,11,"Purchased the No Ads for $3.99. It still shows them! I requested a fix, no response. U requested a refund, no response. I disputed via PayPal and they claim Google showed evidence of service, but I have proof im still getting ads. Finally, PayPal informed me it was showing as a SUBSCRIPTION and not a 1 time payment...! Avoid this app purchase, its a 100% scam."
Hole.io,qz14 41zq,3,4,Good concept but needs more modes. The game play don't last long. There should be unlimited time to see how quick you can wipe clean whole arena. That way players can have fun eating the whole arena rather than quick 2 min game.
Hole.io,Jennifer Martinez,2,3,I Like it but i hate that it ALWAYS Says Please Comfirm your age >:( And its kinda boting at the same time to. So Please Fix That And ill give better ratings :D And Btw Have A Great Day Or Night whoever see's this :) Rate these to stars also when you are Writing a Rating if u Agree That there shouldent be a Please comfirm your age ALL THE TIME! D:< Hope you agree! :D Tell your Favorite Game Down Below and ill write em somthing to about there game and ill be honest! See you later maybe bye bye!!
Hole.io,Whipped Queen,4,1,"I freaking love this! Battle Royale is great but just discovered a problem with it. Me and another hole were the only 2 left, neither sizing up or able to kill each other to end the round plus the city regenerating itself over and over."
Hole.io,Brijesh Pathak,4,,"I wpuld have given this 5 star but I did 4 because there were some problems, in the battle mode, there must be a way to finish game if last two are in max size, and if I could play both online with my friends and offline both then it must be much better"
Hole.io,Sara Stuart,4,2,"Just curious if it's a glitch or I just have never scored high enough...but what do you have to get to to get ""max size""? I used to play this game quite some time ago and just recently started playing again- and I know I've gotten to max size before but lately it seems impossible."
Hole.io,Victoria Carrasco,3,12,"Equal parts fun and frustrating AF. I wish the treasure hunt was just a playing option so I wouldn't be forced to watch a 30 second ad before EVERY play even after I purchased the ad-free version! Like, just offer an extra-ad-free version and I'll pay the damn thing..... still playing though >_< Oh also, I read that the hole was alot faster before they updated it so, again, frustrating feature.... still playing it though."
Hole.io,Oliver,2,10,Game is fun. But there's too many ads They give you the option to watch an ad for some extra points. But then you say 'no thanks' and they make you watch an ad anyways. Very annoying. And they charge too much to remove ads
Hole.io,Jessi McCarthy,5,,"I love this game :3 it doesn't take a lot of focus, it's not hard to understand, and it's a nice time waster when you're waiting on somthing and need to occupy your mind"
Hole.io,A Google user,5,19,I love it.....I love the solo challenge but I cant get 100 percent which to me is half the fun... The ads are what spoils this game but I rated it 5 stars because i like the game...you can get round the ads.... Oh and it would be so much better if you could challenge your friends...
Hole.io,TJ Maddox,1,23,"I used to love this game. I would play it all the time. However, here recently it had been crashing and they are aware of the issue, but have not done anything to fix it. Because of this issue, I will no longer download ANY games by Voodoo. If you would fix the crash issue, it would be a better game."
Hole.io,jason butler,3,3,"Would be much higher if not for the level 19 max with no draw option(currently you have to just straight up kill the app), and if there weren't so many bots in the game with the ability to leave the map, thus causing you to kill the app again(I have a screen cap showing this)."
Hole.io,Gabi Sitzes,4,1,"I really like this game. It's really satisfying to see how much you can ""eat."" The only thing I don't like is how quickly it drains my battery. It would also be cool if they had the option to watch an ad for more time (like in the solo game mode). Other than that I don't have any complaints!"
Hole.io,The best not,5,7,It is a really fun game you can have 3 different versions like solo run one with everybody and the other with people bit you can eat people and they get eliminated but it can be really laggy or some times so if it's leggy just power off your phone and try and see if that works it works well for me and it hasn't lagged yet for me after that so I would try that but you should really get this game it is fun and takes the bordam off of you so I suggest u get this game it's not the best BUT GET THIS
Hole.io,Silver Wolf,5,4,Addicting game. I absolutely love it! If any improvements could be made is that the control response be a tab bit more sensitive. OH! and I need a Zen mode!!!! Pls pls pls!!! Make a Zen mode! Let me travel the world and empty an entire planet!
Hole.io,Tatum Pierce,2,3,"Realized I was playing against bots and even played offline, which is super disappointing. I didn't mind the ads either since half were skippable but it's stupid to lie on your website that it's an online multiplayer when it isn't."
Hole.io,balkishori solanki,4,,Nice game but the main thing is that the game should be a little approved because when the hole is smaller the things on the beach are difficult to put in and the same is on the classic modeüòÄüòÄ
Hole.io,Kevin Reed,5,15,This has been a great game! Its fin and simple. I like being able to play online and off. I did notice like.some.others that in the the battle royalle mode that when the remaining two players are both at level 19 they are stuck without backing out and starting over again
Hole.io,Aly Riekkoff,4,2,"Yumyumgumdrop here. Love the game. Graphics are a little cheesy, and there are a fair amount of ads, but the game is simply addictive! Thank for fixing the bugs! Plays great!"
Hole.io,Jack Sherwood,4,8,Great game fun I defiantly would recommend this game to people who want to have fun and Pac time...the only thing I think you guys should add is an option to go faster because once you start to get bigger you start to slow down.But overall great game!
Hole.io,Demitrios Casianos,4,4,"This game is great. It'sincredibly addictive but it needs polish. Having 2, 3 and 5 minute matches and even solo runs with unlimited time would benefit this game greatly. Really the major problem plaguing this game is the short timer."
Hole.io,SigGuy 320,1,5,"It was fun, until one day it got ridiculously easy and you could no longer lose. Then, just recently, it started crashing halfway through each game. You can't complete a single game anymore. If an update doesn't come soon, I'll be deleting it."
Hole.io,jeff winter,5,,Addicting and fun! Simple idea that has me hooked. I like it a lot. Just wish the ads would go away but I know how they make üí∞ too.
Hole.io,Finn Merryweather,5,2,This is one of the best games that I have found on Google play I would recommend this to everyone who has a phone it's a great way to pass the time and it's just hard and easy enough that you rarely get mad playing it it's a 10/10 game
Hole.io,Michael Allender,3,2,Long time player here. Is like to know how some players start bigger. Within 2 seconds of playing I was eaten by a MUCH larger hole than I. I know they started out bigger because there is no way they got that big that quick. If there is a booster I would love to know how to get it. I paid for no ads.
Hole.io,cathy Acaster,2,14,Updated.. can't play game anymore as nothing to play I've done all challenges update NEEDED more levels/game modes Good game my issue is I downloaded it a day n had ago and can go no further as I'm maxed on points this needs changing. . This game if you had more options of playing wether more points or more game modes would be great as I say I can't progress.
Hole.io,David Garcia,5,9,"My daughter loves this game. I wish there was a way to purchase more game time, especially concerning the younger players. I would gladly purchase more than the standard 2 minutes, otherwise it's pretty interesting"
Hole.io,miss 2000,3,2,This is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I just wish the solo mode wasn't timed or there was a free run mode where you were allowed to eat the entire map. Less than 2 minutes makes this game very unsatisfying. It has so much potential though.
Hole.io,christopher jackson,3,8,"Fun game, but one add for brick crusher keeps popping up and it put the game to an all black screen where you have to close the game and open it again to continue playing. This one ad has made the game unplayable for me."
Hole.io,Emely martineze,5,3,"It's a very good game, you can get new skins, you're gonna have to buy them, just play and play, and you will get so many skins, I almost have all of them already, this game is the best game I have ever found in the app store. Download it now and you have so much friend."
Hole.io,KiDD Controversy,5,,"I love this game, i just hate the time limit. If the time limit was removed and the setting was a last man standing, Id probably never stop playing"
Hole.io,Chrystal Molter,3,,Game starts to close out while playing or just freezes on loading between levels. I'm constantly having to restart the app. Please fix this issue.
Hole.io,A Google user,5,128,"Fabulous. This game is exactly as it describes. You are a hole that gets bigger as you eat more. This one of the best games I have ever played. One more thing, try to reduce the amount of ads in the game. So yeah this is one of the best games I have ever played. 100% recommended."
Hole.io,kookie bts,2,4,Seriously it get boring after you get all the skins. Sometimes it glitches which get me annoyed and if you do the mode where you have to be the last hole sometimes you are on the same level so the game goes on for ages. I think I might delete it now.
Hole.io,Charlie Ping,1,14,"So many bugs. Battle Royale can often end in a stalemate, because a bot is stuck somewhere or two are on level 19 and can't progress. There is no way to quit so you have to force stop. You earn skins but they do not show up as options. Just a mess. It's a shame because the game play is good."
Hole.io,Rezia Hossain,4,5,Addictive game needs a few tweaks. As u get bigger it gets harder to move so please increase speed. There are only 3 scenes. Please can we have a few to choose from and also have levels of difficulty then this would definitely be a 5*game!!
Hole.io,Zachary Christopher,3,1,"App is fun, but the ""max size"" bug needs to be fixed in classic mode. I've hit 2,000 points many times and never get any bigger, but I still haven't gotten the max size skin. I'm seeing a lot of people say the same thing online."
Hole.io,s martin,1,85,"Deleting this game and not downloading another .io game until they actually provide a PvP against real players. The ai that they use is terrible, if you leave them long enough they glitch and end up off the map for ages and if they become the same size as you, you lose the ability to eat them so you're stuck on the game without being able to end it other than to close the app down. The heat that my phone generated trying to run the game is unreal. There is more that I'd like to say but no space"
Hole.io,Tim Musoni,4,5,Honestly think it's a really fun game and I really like it it's fun it's just really satisfying to pick up all of the pieces and I really do recommend it the only tiny issue is that I don't know I don't know if this happens to you but but when is the end of the game the phone or device sometimes just vibrate and I don't really like it however overall really fun games I do recommend that you should really play it
Hole.io,Dakota Chesnut,1,6,"So I downloaded this game haven't played in awhile but it isn't like it used to be, it used to have a play with friends mode, but also it wasn't glitched black in every skin you use too, other than that I'd give it 5 stars"
Hole.io,Tim pesch,5,,I love this game but i also suggest a new mode called free play. The mode would have no time limit and no points. Just play that mode for fun
Hole.io,Jon Scott,4,1,"Simple game, easy to control with tough challenges and good graphics. Surprisingly imaginative. You don't get ads if you play offline but you won't get bonuses or treasure chest challenges either."
Hole.io,AJ,1,5,"Have to rate 1 star now, no way to max out hole size in classic mode so you can never unlock the pigskin, thus never unlocking the frog skin. Also no way to win in battle mode, if you and opponent reach lvl 19 at the same time. App must be force quit and you lose everything for that round. The last update broke this game. If youre a completionist, AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
Hole.io,Diego Kober,4,4,"Interesting premise, but while I do like the competitive modes, I'd like really to have an optional solo game mode without time constraints, to just be able to screw around the map swallowing everything. No pressure, just fun, you know."
Hole.io,Sugandhav Mathur,4,2,"This is a very nice game. I have named my hole ""the queen of holes. But, l have a complaint about your game. It hangs a lot and sometimes it crashes. Pls fix this bug. Otherwise this is a very nice game. I love this game!!!üëåüëåüòäüòä"
Hole.io,Sam H,5,4,This game is very addictive and when you start there is no going back. This game is affordable (no money) and enjoyable to play. If you like games that you can control with your finger you will love this.
Hole.io,miranda S,3,86,"Fun game to pass the time. But only for a few days. Would be better if you played against actual people. And if you could add friends and join in on their game. Even if there were still computers, having a few real people to play with would make this so much better."
Hole.io,Geoffrey Lamphier,4,23,"Very entertaining game. Some strategic planning/thinking required. Only criticism would be the flat 2 minute timer. Would love to see an additional 30 seconds on game modes. Other than that, great time-killing game."
Hole.io,Ryan Wemyss,1,11,"Kids game but demands for constant privacy and data concent. That is very concerning... And I don't have kids of my own, also it is full of micro transactions. Clearly showing what the developers want, is cash cash cash and the product/game has been optimised to be addicting as it is only 2 mins at a time with a force advert in between plays."
Hole.io,Cam Man,5,1,Fun game bought the no ads version. This blew up on youtube a while ago. I still play it often. It's a fun game to play in between periods of boredom. Very fun in general.
Hole.io,platinum GAMING,1,6,very very bad app.first of all-too much of adds.literlly they always glitch the game it never works properly and this is not an app for gaming it is a app for seeing ads because the game glitches and except the game(that always glitches)it has only add adds more adds.what di you think of it? if you think the same click the helpful button belowüëá.and remember this is the worst game.do not download it. üò£ü§êüòîüò¢ü§™üòµ.and stay home stay safeü§´üò∑üòá.bye.last time this is the most worst game.
Hole.io,Ruvel Sunil,5,1,"It is super nice and I loved because we could play it offline also. There isnt much advertising, which is good. It is fun to play as well"
Hole.io,James Tawse,5,23,I think this is a really great app to get You can get killed #bestgames You can win and eat other people (holes) Get this app now it doesn't even have any ads #bonus The only bad thing is the timer ‚è≤Ô∏èbecause it only gives a 5min count down which isnt to bad though But best game I have Im actually editing this a few years later and ot isnt a great app its an axtravahansa app
Hole.io,James Caudillo,5,6,This game is sooo cool you can go to Game Modes and you be the winner if you pick the first one or the last and you don't get as much as on the other games so I gave this one all stars to but if other people don't like it is ok with me cause I can't control everyone in this game üòÇüòÇüòÜ hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. So if y'all don't like it you don't have to you don't have to fit in so have fun and be saveü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçü§üü§üü§ü
Hole.io,Alexander Cadalin,4,2,"Fun game. There's a problem with Battle Royale. If the remaining players all reach level 19, it results into a deadlock, with all the players endlessly eating the landscape away, with no one being able to eat another or be eaten."
Hole.io,Helen Bobias,3,1,"Buggy since April 2020 update. Can't go back to day city or space city. Not random game background anymore. All are treasure island, and has a treasure hunt for what? No status displayed on what you have achieved except for the first time you open the app to play."
Hole.io,Irimescu Diana Cristina,4,,"Love the game but for the past few days, after about 2-3 matches, when I get an ad, it gets stuck in ""Loading"" and i have to close the entire thing and restart it."
Hole.io,xxx xxx,2,6,"Has gone downhill in the past year or so. Extremely laggy, their should be a control button on if you let go of the screen you stop vice versa. Their should be more settings than just vibrations and restore purchases."
Hole.io,Harley Mackey,4,2,"For what it is, a simple time passer, 5 stars. Just glitches sometimes and lags a little. All in all good game. One of those that I keep downloading on each new phone."
Hole.io,Bobby Burns,5,8,Too fun. Perfectly entertaining and easy to put back down. No click bait or trying to sell you anything.. paid for the ad free version because whoever made this deserves my money.
Hole.io,‚Ä¢ Lizzy ‚Ä¢,2,1,I love this game! But when I got maxed and become bigger the game glitch/shut itself down :(.i'm very disappointed since back then I had no problems with the except ads.. Pls fix this problem I really appreciate it if u do
Hole.io,Heather B,5,7,"Very simple but amusing. I wish there was a solo level where you eat everything and then can try and beat your best fime, instead of always having the 2min limit."
Hole.io,Heidi Holliday,2,4,I like the concept of the game but there isn't many scene options and it continually freezes and glitches. It will boot me out a lot. Please fix these glitches so I can enjoy this game
Hole.io,Relicym R,4,,"Gameplay is pretty good, but 2 mins is too short. Game gets laggier the bigger you get. Drains the battery very quickly. Too many ads, best played offline."
Hole.io,Cella F,4,,It's fun not to many ads Wich is nice. Although I can't seem to pass the solo round. I'm not sure it gives you enough time to do it.
Hole.io,Stephen Plummer,4,25,Great little addictive game. Only gripes are that it keeps crashing after the bricks ball crusher ad. V.annoying and would like the option to play a map for longer than 2 minutes at a time. Other than that really enjoying it. Thanks!
Hole.io,[ Roblox Carefree Coffee ],4,6,I love this game but i wish it had more challenges and achievements i already maxed out my level in just 5 days! I wish that things are like more harder than just eating and eating things but if these things happen i will change to five stars thx!
Hole.io,Luis Martinez,4,,"The game is alright, but I wish they include an actual online play instead of just bots. But overall, this was a good game and a great time-killer during quarantine."
Hole.io,C2 Cox,5,,"I love this game so much! The game modes are fun, the skins are cool, and the maps are really cool! I would rate this 6/5 if I could, and the ads don't bother me at all. 5/5 stars for me."
Hole.io,dragonslaye2000,3,,"It's a good game, but is a bit laggy and sometimes adds pop out of the blue and I need to watch it. But sometimes when I come back, I got eaten. I hope u can fix the add!"
Hole.io,Ali Ridwan,1,3,"I don't why I'm in love with this game, but I feel like this game still need improvement like the sound, this game has no sound. Also this makes battery of phone drained so fast and more heat as long as you okay it."
Hole.io,Nathan Anthony,4,4,"I love the game but, the game sometimes stops in the middle of the game, & it makes me return to the home screen. ( I don't know if it's just a Samsung problem) ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ"
Hole.io,jo alexander,5,8,"Great Simple Offline Game. Easy to learn. Fun to pass a few minutes. Ads are a pain, but it's a free game."
Hole.io,Stephanie Sowers,2,,"Really enjoy the game, but it keeps shutting down and freezing. Would give it a 5 if these issues are fixed!"
Paper.io2,David Junkman,2,87,"Fun game. Ads are beyond ridiculous. Play more than 4 sec and get an Ad. Choose to watch an Ad to get a second life? Sometimes it glitch kills you immediately. Have another Ad, even if you died immediately. Sure, you can pay to remove the adds, but the quantity of adds they make you wade through makes it feel more like extortion. Don't recommend. I only gave it a second star because they game itself is fun."
Paper.io2,Alisdair Hunter,1,55,So many glitches. You cross paths to kill opponents and nothing happens. Your opponents appear to travel at warp speed occasionally to kill you. You start on the line of another and die instantly. The game doesn't register the days you log in to increase the skins you can use. You cut off some of your opponents 'land' and all yours disappears. Nice idea and can pass the time but awful gameplay.
Paper.io2,Min's Tree Lane,3,1741,"It's quite a good app. Gameplay is simple, you have stuff to work for and the skins are cool. It is a very addictive game and a good way to pass the time but there are way too many ads and it has a tendency to glitch (probably some what just my internet but my other games aren't too bad). For no apparent reason you can just die, and when you watch an ad to revive half the time it doesn't even work. Overall it's a good. I gave it 3 stars because of the glitching but otherwise I would give it 5."
Paper.io2,Kaitlyn Gregory,4,400,"Good game really. But I wish that you could make it more, intresting. But like I said good game. I think there are to many ads, I know they have to make there money and all. But I think that all over the top, but what do you expect it is a free game. I also wish that you could make achivements, I know there are some but, like I like the daily achevments,levels, and maps. But I dont want to make a simple game complex."
Paper.io2,xKOKOLINOx,4,961,"I honestly LOVE this game üòçüòçüòçü§©ü§©ü§© The only reason it's a 4-star is that there is an ad right after you die. For me that's much too often, but then it might not be a big of a problem for others. Also I would appreciate it if you added more skins but this time not for achievements but for money(also to be added), and you could get some cash for example, for a kill or 10%, and then spend that money on those skins. I'm not as keen on this one as on the other one, but maybe make your own skins?"
Paper.io2,jerome mathiasen,5,220,"So at first i loved this game. But quickly it became a nightmare. I honestly still like the game and everything about it, however due to the constant glitching out of the area that is taken over i refuse to give this game more than 1 star. The worst part about this is that i paid the money to have this app. If you get this game you will immediately be disappointed. The devs need to fix this asap."
Paper.io2,Frank Lee,5,210,"I absolutely love this game. I love the skins that it has. It's simply, but just the right amount for it to be addicting. Even though there is a lot of ads, idk! Because arent adds the things that get us some of our best games?! Even though they can be annoying at times. I get about 97% of my games from adds! xD"
Paper.io2,Zeena The garbage cat,2,479,"It's a good game but there are 3 things I need to address, first of all I've been playing this game for 1 week now, but I did not get any of the skins, second of all, the ads, for some reason, the phone version has ALOT of adds, every 1-2 games there are ADDS, the ads are too much, and I'm to going to pay because its going to he a waste if money, lastly, the controls arent even working!! I'm trying to go to one direction and it takes me to the other, and I canr move, and I end up getting killed"
Paper.io2,maksuda ahmed,5,85,"I think the game should be upgraded,,,,,,there are some bugs which need to be cleaned ,,,,,, and the creater of game should provide more skins so the player playing the game can have many options in choosing ,,,, and there are some glitch which needs to be fixed . Positively the game is really good,,,,, really attractive and fun to playand really good to pass time . I myself think the game should be updated . But no matter how this game is I really love this game and hope to have more skins ."
Paper.io2,LilBambo_ Anime,3,362,It sometimes moves me in a random direction and that gets quite annoying.In other words it's a lot of fun!It makes me feel relaxed to try and make a big base.I love the avatars too.Two other complaints tho.I think it has a little too many ads.And there are glitches.I dont like them at ALL!But in other words it's a great game!I totally recommend it.
Paper.io2,Thomas McGibbon,5,162,"This game is great! I have had it before I reinstalled it because I wanted to play it again. I see a lot of bad reviews on this game honestly I don't see how it's bad. I've seen a lot of people saying that there's a lot of ads, but what people don't realize is that people have reasons for putting ads in games. If a game is free, then how is the company going to make money off of it? Five stars good job voodooüòÅ"
Paper.io2,ahsan pijlman,4,81,"So easy and simple. Love the graphics. Only one thing could you add more skins like wolves and lions,tigers and vultures, buildings. For me there is not enough skins to collect. Please fix this it is otherwise a perfect simple but hard game. Also change hiw many ads there are way to many and not enough playing!"
Paper.io2,Alyssa Sedgy,1,113,"This game would be fun if you could play it without having to die all the time and the ads to revive yourself actually working. I got to around 30% twice to have it take me back to 0% instantly. Then I'd ""kill"" bots by running over their lines and it doesn't register and then I die. This game is so frustrating! The 3D version is sooooo much more fun. Don't bother with this one. Not worth your time"
Paper.io2,Anastasya JK,2,13,"There's a glitch. A piece of my land disappeared out of thin air and when I checked it, no one even stole it! Sometimes it happened to other players too, please fix it. There's no way to win 100% land if there's a glitch like this :( *edit: 2020 and the glitch is still there smh"
Paper.io2,A Google user,3,45,"Gameplay is fun and competitive, but the controls are lacking. They will occasionally lag and not respond making you open for attack. Latest find: If you get up in the 30% range your entire area disappears leaving you high and dry. When this happened to me I was in the center of my area."
Paper.io2,ÍßÅFreakÍßÇ,5,88,This is such a great game!!SUPER addicting!I can play forever! The ads are alittle off limits in when I bought the no ad thing it literally took my money like a cash machine so if you fix that then I would put a 5-star review but although this game is really fun and I just installed it to write a good / bad review! ‚ô•
Paper.io2,Mikayla Gilfoil,1,232,This game sucks I don't recommend getting it. I played 1 game and none of the controls were working I tried to turn but the game wouldn't let me and it made me mad. I didn't get any ads but I heard from other people that there are to many ads. Also all those people are just bots their not real. The game was really glitchie to It was so glitchie that it was really hard to play the game. My final review is that this game is trash just please don't waste your time playing it thank you and good bye
Paper.io2,Tom V,2,79,"The game itself is very fun. Very simple, self-explanatory and such. I enjoy playing it. BUT I' be never seen an app push this many ads. And they're super long as well. An ABSURD amount of ads. Ruins the fun entirely. Also, the gameplay is buggy. Enemies can literally respawn on your head, killing you. You opt to watch a 30s Ad to continue playing just to come back to your character dead. Or sometimes your territory just vanishes leaving you at 0% but alive.. A great idea with flawed execution."
Paper.io2,Dimple nanda,3,6,"Superb!BUT THE REASON WHY I GAVE IT 3 STARS IS BECAUSE IT HAS LOTS OF ADS.IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU PLAY FOR 10 MINUTES OR HOURS,IT WILL SHOW YOU ADS AFTER EACH MATCH(BIG)AND ALSO POP-UP ADS WHEN YOU ARE NOT PLAYING.. OTHER THING,THE PURCHASES IN THIS APP ARE NOT DONE THROUGH GAME COINS,BUT THROUGH ADS WHICH IS SUPER UNSATISFAYING.PLEASE STOP ADSüôèüèª"
Paper.io2,Benett Malcolm,3,,"Okay, but has problems. The gameplay is solid, I'm even good at it, but it causes my phone to overheat like crazy, and the ads, while not unbearable, are a little annoying... I mean it happens every single battle."
Paper.io2,Lesley Sniper,1,243,"This game is bad. When I played a bit it said"" Paper.io 2 is not working now"". I played the second time and it said the same thing. It had LOTS of ads. I'm very sad because I used to play this and it was perfectly good no its just ads and lies(""Paper.io is not working now"") I was not trying to be rude but it is not a good game for kids because it has a lot of ads and the children's will not like it they will find it very annoying. I would not play this game anymore. I do not recommend."
Paper.io2,Ed Sweitzer,1,695,"Ads upon ads. üíµ üí∞üí∏ You finally cover 100% of the map? Great job! Here's the same 15-second ad for visible you've seen 862 times! Congrats!

Watch a 30-second video for extra life, and the person who killed you is in the same spot when you're done. üôÑ Did I mention there are too many ads? üìÑ"
Paper.io2,Ruby Tuesday,1,136,"Fun game but very glitchy. Almost never get to finish a level because it will glitch and not let you control your game peice. Came back a year later to give it another try, it's even worse than before. Absolutely horrible game. Great premise, doesn't work at all. Waste of time and space on my phone."
Paper.io2,Noelle Pelsor,4,12,"Super fun game, addicting. Many ads but the game is free. The ads go by fast. 4 stars only because the game freezes occasionally.

Paper.io2,Leslie Ruben,3,109,"I used to love this game, very addicting...but I never do the extra life ads as they almost NEVER save you. The game is super glitchy...I was just rocking it at 23% and my base starts disappearing...I cant see what's killing me but my base percent keeps getting lower and lower...I assumed at first white base that you cant see (which by the way would be super stupid!) But there was no white one on the leaderboard...very frustrating...not 1st time dont want to but might just uninstall :("
Paper.io2,Arella Bailey,2,,"I really loved this app and it was fun to play. But it offers the watch an ad and you can continue, but every time it ""continues"" i immediately die. Like the game doesnt even load up all the way before it states I've died."
Paper.io2,Dilyana,1,108,"There's a lot of push to turn on personalized ads, which leaves a bad tastes when it's a personal choice. Edit, that privacy settings message is up CONSTANTLY which I did not expect. Not sure for how long I can tolerate it. Sucks cause I really like the game. EDIT: EVERY TIME I RESTART THE GAME my privacy settings get reset. Excuse you, I've already saved them, how about you don't force consent?!"
Paper.io2,Austin Shoupe,2,186,"This game would be good if they took care of some serious issues. First, the camera's entirely too close so it's hard to see what's going on around you. Second, you spawn into really chaotic parts of the map sometimes and are immediately killed. Third, the amount of time it takes to get back into the game is too long as it almost always requires sitting through an ad. I like the concept, but the logistics are in the way. They need to find a new way to work in ads at least."
Paper.io2,Rebecca Boynton,2,77,"It's really annoying because I can't listen to spotify while playing the game it just shuts it down. I've gone through my phone settings and everything. I think it's just a bug or something . Can u please fix this!!! It would make play the game more as well. It would also be nice if we could create servers to play with our friends, and create our own skins. It would also be nice if there was money so u can buy more skins with the earned money."
Paper.io2,LOVE SHARMA,1,50,"1. U may download this game but its waste of time u can never win in this game . 2. It contains lots of ads or i should say a continous series of ads in every 2 min. 3. It gets VERY LAGGY sometimes. 4. When u have captured more than 30 percent all the CPU players tries to kill u or either cut ur base i.e., they then dont kill each other their target is only u. # If u want to play this game, play without internet so that u can avoid ads. # If someone is able to score more than 60% then plz tell"
Paper.io2,plutogirlz Zz,3,63,"The games really good, but there are waaaaaay to many adds. It's getting to the point where I have to use some sort of hack to get past the adds to play it because the adds are blocking the screen,it sometimes doesn't even work!!

Paper.io2,Mama Troy and The Gang,1,103,This game would be really fun if it would allow you to get bigger than 30%!! Every time I get to that size the game glitches and I'm killed automatically either my circle disappears or somebody comes into my color and kills me. You need to fix the glitches because it's a serious downfall. This game is rigged! Also you do not get the skins for consecutive log ins. That is also rigged.
Paper.io2,Scallop Jr,2,130,"Very low quality, is always glitching, and WAYYYY too many adds. I'm not usually the one to complain, but if I had to complain about something, it'd be this. Not one star quality, but more a 2 maybe 3, but then again, this is just a bad game. Kinda addictive, which can be both good and bad. My opinion."
Paper.io2,Purplegirl,2,107,"So, and I'm not exaggerating when I say this, I downloaded it, opened it, and there was immediate glittching. It was being weird when I was simply attempting to put in my nickname. I thought that that was the only issue, so I was like, ""Okay, whatever."" And clicked to play the game. When I tried to move my character, it would only sometimes move. I wound up dying because of this. Then, after the ad it basically BROKE and my phone screen went black. I spent a solid minute turning it back on."
Paper.io2,The Art Artist,5,39,This game is pretty good! I definitely think you should install this game. This app does not have an excessive adds every 3 seconds. It can get a little annoying because all the people playing are soooo good. But the point is that this game is really good and you NEED it.
Paper.io2,Hethre Gneiting,5,6,"I love this game it,s Awesome I love it it is a very good game and cool. But it isn't paper well it dosen't look like paper. but pretty close it is cool and it's a little difficult but I love the skins so much like the donut skin yes please I love it so much and the car skin and the toilet lol so cute lol I can wight all day long about how awesome and cute and fun"
Paper.io2,Starry Night,1,33,"I was playing as a normal size and was going really good! I had over 30% of the map and was confident i could get to 50% ! Glitch time. BUT, as I was tracing, it made me 5 √ó bigger and apparently i was 0.73% and what big mass i had was now gone, invisible. Then I died, and all of that hard work was for NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING."
Paper.io2,kendra davis,4,19,Best game I have ever played. why I gave it 4 stars was because if you had takin your eye of the screen someone could kill you and one other thing I believe that in this game it is very frustrating to accept the fact that you were the king and you killed yourself because ran into your line of paper
Paper.io2,Mr.Doggo,1,16,"LET ME JUST START! THIS IS BORING WITH THE MOST ANNOYIING BOTS I HAVE EVER SEEN. HOW CAN ANYBODY CALL THIS A .IO GAME,THIS ISN'T EVEN REAL MULTIPLAYER IT IS JUST AN AI!!

I would not even give it a single star but unfortunatly I have to to write a comment. Overall don't download only a game to make you angry. Not even worth anyones time. ..........."

Paper.io2,Lucy Hart,5,1020,"I love this game a lot but I really think they should add more features like: City or town,Buildings,killing gives you tokens(which should also be a future update).Building houses will cost tokens.Upgrades(speed,money per kill,etc).Levels that give you tokens,upgrades,etc.Also you can add stuff like more button controls. Otherwise,I still love this game!"
Paper.io2,Marti Vincze,3,,Skins for consecutive days not awarded I have been playing for a week every day but the skins that the game awards for playing every day is not awarded to me. That's a bummer but it's a great game. Can be played offline too which is great when I travel.
Paper.io2,Christina Booker,1,6,"I had to Google how this game is played. There was no tutorial. After I looked it up, I tried to practice but I can only stay alive for 5 seconds at a time. I also have to deal with an ad (sometimes 2) after every death. It feels a little pointless to keep trying"
Paper.io2,Drew Feille,2,399,"Once I start taking over a large area, the graphics consistently begin glitching and I can't see what I'm doing. It's extremely frustrating after spending so much time in that game session. I had also assumed that, because of the .io name, it was a multiplayer game like agar io. I didn't notice that the game is actually listed as an offline singleplayer game."

Paper.io2,Zoii Leyco,3,,Nice game but I would love it if there was a mini map to see where u are and ur progress and other players. Plus there's a glitch that whenever I watch an ad for an extra life I die immediately after even though nobody killed me.
Paper.io2,Sara Pfeiffer,5,20,I am rating this game because somthing comes up and asks me to to rate it and then someone kills me while it is up. That has happened tp me twice but the second time I was the king. Other than that it is a very fun game and people should get it but rate it before playing!!
Paper.io2,Thecoolguytaker,2,2,Great game but there are way to many ads like every time you die there is an ad I would definitely enjoy the game a lot more if if it weren't for the ads. But overall a really great game.

Paper.io2,Justin Bazylewicz,5,433,"It's a game where you start out as a little circle and move around to get more .Ps you need to touch your base after you get as much as you want.just be careful of enemy's because they can steal some of your base and KILL you.just make sure you get 100% of the map and your fine.i hope everyone who comes past this game downloads it because it's really fun to play and again,I hope everyone who comes past this game downloads it.make sure you have fun playing this game.lol I just like this a lot Idk"

Paper.io2,Leah Reinier,2,1,"Ok, so I dont understand how youtubers have been just circling outside the entire map and not even getting killed? And what is it about the invisible glitch? And when I get to 20 or 10 and past, it kicks me off the game, doesnt give me the skins I earned, and doesmt save my progress. I would be ok with this game and I am , other than these problems. I dont exactly know if other people have these problems, but please fox them so I can give this game 5 stars."

Paper.io2,Natalia Olewinski,5,98,This is an awesome game I definitely recommend it it is so fun there's a little bit of ads but you know every game is that bad and it's amazing you can put it anywhere you want it's time-consuming and it's amazing so you definitely get it but the only thing is if you don't play it with Wi-Fi it sometimes lags and it kills you automatically but that's the only thing I definitely remember recommend it

Paper.io2,Camilla Bolton,1,208,"It is super glitchy and unplayable, the online one works better than the actual app. It would have been fun if it wasn't so glitchy.What I mean about glitchy is that when you you start the game it doesnt let you move , you just go forward without having controll over how you move. I definitely DO NOT recommend this app. I am definitely going to delete it now."

Paper.io2,THICKYVICKI,4,19,"This game is the best. Since this quarantine started,I've been playing this game for at least 1 month. I love the graphics,the controls are sometimes laggy,and to much ads. Like when I play a round after I die there's an ad"
Paper.io2,Rishita Lohani,3,1,Nice than 1 but not good then third one as the third one is 3D and it is very easy than this one when I downloaded paper.io 3D I just stop playing this one actually this one is harder than the paper.io 3D and the third was very very easy and good so I recommend you guys to download paper.io 3D
Paper.io2,Mat Ward,1,,"Paid for ad free, but it keeps nagging with banner pop-ups to share my data. Ask once maybe, but not after every game! Shouldn't have paid."
Paper.io2,Tristan Sharp,5,1,Loads of fun for ¬£1.70 or whatever it is to take the ads off. I've had this game a couple of months now and is probably my favourite casual game on Android.
Paper.io2,Sugandhav Mathur,5,15,"I love this game.l thought this game was cool and it really is!!! .There are no pop - up ads. It doesn't hang , and I don't believe other people who give 1 or 2 stars because I loving this game!!!! Another masterpiece made by VOODOO!!!!!"
Paper.io2,Am _ Weird,4,5,"Hi! I love this game! As it is fun and helps me not be bored! I understand that people are complaining about the glitchiness, but I personally think it was just lag."
Paper.io2,KaitlynPlays21,4,2,I like the game with the skins and playthrough.What I don't like are the ADS and the GLITCHES.I suggest for the game developers to fix the GLITCH and ADS also maybe they should be able to play with friends.Besides ADS and GLITCHES this game is addicting and fun to play overall!
Paper.io2,Rex Joseph,4,53,"Amazing gameüòÉnot to many adds , fun things to do if u want to unlock a new skin . The only reason I did not give the fivth star is because there was task to stay 15 seconds out and I went out for 23 seconds and the skin did not unlock and I went out many times for more than 15 seconds and there was no changeüôÑ"
Paper.io2,Howard Amat,2,6,"This game tries to make you think you are playing real people but you are just playing the computer, all the other players are actually AI using names of other Chumps like you who are playing the computer too. Your avatar does not matter as nobody sees it except you. Why can't they just make it so you play other people and not try to cheat? It would be five stars if it was a live game but I give It 2 for entertainment value. Man up voodoo and doo the right thing, make it live, no bots."
Paper.io2,Lenae & Marie,4,16,"I like this game, paper.io 2 is pretty addicting and may or may not be keeping me up at night. The only problem is, is AD's. They are super annoying and just ruin the fun, other than that it's a good game and I recommend you getting this app. üëç"
Paper.io2,Joseph Wild,2,10,The game glitches a lot and you lose all your territory for no reason. 28% plus and I only have 3% one second later. Fix this and the spawn rate so someone can win and I might change my mind. I'm even considering deleting the app due to these issues.
Paper.io2,GunToast Gaming,2,14,It would be a great game if it was not so glitchy it is like whenever I am near another player it freezes the whole game then when it unfreezes I am dead but if the game is not glitching it would be a 4 or 5 star rating so for you it could be a great game. So bye everyone üëã
Paper.io2,Xx Golden skull Xx,4,3,I came across a bug I think and it was the 2nd day that I played this any back to the bug I was playing to day and I couldn't touch the screen until I went off the game idk what happened but the game is really cool and I probably play this every day but the bug I didn't like bc I can't play it then I'm sad about it and I had to keep restarting the game over and over again so I will give this 4 stars bc of the bug :D
Paper.io2,Emily Cobb,5,4,It's the best game ever I still like the original better but this one is amazing too there aren't too many ads and it's pretty nice the graphics are nice and overall it's great and super fun
Paper.io2,Yashvi S,2,1,The game is really good but there a so many ads!! I mean every second an ad pops up and when we try to get x3 lives it tells us to watch an ad and after watching it nothing happens.
Paper.io2,Bella LaVette,5,,The game runs very smooth and the overall concept is exceptional. Getting new skins and as many kills as possible is always a challenge. Love this game!
Paper.io2,Miesha Govil,1,47,"Pathetic. It keeps glitching out. It won't let me play. As soon as I click the play button. It says I've been killed. And I know it's a glitch because ive been playing this game since a long time. I had to change my review from a 5 star to a 1 star but if I had the option to give zero stars, I would."
Paper.io2,carolina G,4,50,"Ok i love it i play when am on the bus its fun but right now there doing ""start 5 times bigger!""

Paper.io2,The Average Adventurers,5,20,it's not bad that's a little bit hard and I don't really like that and it's really hard to get the whole thing so can you make a little bit easier and a lot more but thank you so much for making this game I really like it so who made this game and I'm 8 years old and my name is Baiya and I can't believe that anybody who would even hate this thanks for making this game üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Paper.io2,A Finney,2,13,"Crashes often, crashed my phone once, and it is so full of unskippable ads. Other players obviously bots and way too difficult to kill. 100% of the map is nearly impossible.

Paper.io2,Mattie Kewen,5,20,"My Personal Experience From This Game Is If U Want A App Chalenging this Is it. The Graphics Are Great.

I Love the Detailing of the Skins u Can Earn.It is so Challenging, And Enjoyable. I Would deffinitly Recommend Downloading this App.It is fun And UWouldnt Get bored playingit"
Paper.io2,Sarah Lloyd,5,22,"It is an amazing experience. To play this is a wonderful feeling and a MAJOR time killer. Many of my friends had the fame so I wanted to see why it was so much fun and as soon as I played, h was addicted! Best game ever!"
Paper.io2,Jay p,1,86,How about not playing against a computer for starters. I see them 5 seep coming after me cross thier line nothing. They cross each others nothing. But they get you. No matter how big randomly your zone will dissappear. Sometimes leaving you with nothing to go back to .. fix this. At least make it fun to play
Paper.io2,Uzma Taj,2,1,I love this game ive had it probably close to a week but there is a down side i cant control it as well as when i first got the game witch was not a long time so i deleted the app and installed again hoping the problem would be fixed but no i actully had more problems then last time
Paper.io2,Sathappan Prabhakaran,1,1,"This. Game. Is . So. Not. Fair. Even if you get up to 40%, it drops back down to 2%!! Please fix it. It is so annoying. Don't download this game."
Paper.io2,Thomas O'Sullivan,3,1,Fun game but sometimes glitchy when you build over people's land and they should fix this and I'm suprise it has not been fix . You should try paper.io 3 it sounds cool and new
Paper.io2,CNH Consultants,2,2,It's a good game but there's a big problem whenever I try to revive it shows the advertisment but I doesn't really revive it shows just from the starting and that's not good thing and there is no sound
Paper.io2,Dakot Yates,1,,This is the worst game ever! I hate it! Usually I like all the games I play! But not this one! It is the dumbest game I have ever played! If you feel the same please say this was helpful!
Paper.io2,Phillip Maclachlan,3,10,"Game is a simple enough time killer, balanced with ads and gameplay so you never feel bombarded. However, game does have a nasty habit of glitching out the more space you score, laggy and spikey the more you play. Otherwise... not a bad game."
Paper.io2,Julia San Roman,1,18,"The whole ""Play with other players"" stuff! Yeah just all lies!!! They are bots! I was playing and I was at 41. something and my whole space vanished!!! I was almost to 50!!! New high score RUINED!!! Happend today too!!! And I was only at 19!!! Game sucks!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
Paper.io2,Hadlee Schultz,4,14,Its a great game but when you play on mobile there are so many other players on the game so its really hard to get 100%. also i wish there was an online mode bcz in slither.io there is online mode. but overall its i love this game. Definitely get this game!!!
Paper.io2,Lana Elsayed,3,25,I really liked the game alot but I want it to be online so I can play with my friends and you can friend people that would be awesome but that's all my proplems if you fixed them I will gladly change this review into five stars and I will tell my friends about this game. Thankyou have a good day thanks for your time
Paper.io2,Andrew Baacke,3,25,"Riddled with bugs, ads don't work, and constant crashes. If an ad for an extra life does work, it'll just randomly kill you a few seconds after starting, even if you're way the middle of your own area with no other players in sight."
Paper.io2,Natalie Brydson,1,8,Very upsetting the game glitches switches to the ads whenever it wants and even when I'm winning it restarts it to where I have nowhere to go back to so I end up losing I don't like the game something needs to be fixed.
Paper.io2,Scott Baker,1,2,"Total garbage. 10 seconds of play, 2 minutes of ads. Excessive permissions. Redirects ratings to e-mail if you don't give them 5 stars. Ban this dev."
Paper.io2,Diana Drake,3,1,I love the game but it was a bit hard at first when I first got it I didn't really know what I was doing at first but towards the end it was kind of getting abit easy but it's a really fun game and I do recommend you getting it
Paper.io2,Devon Campana,5,,I love this game üòç it is great there aren't to many ads and the skins are cut and not easy but not impossible to get.
Paper.io2,Karri-Sebastian Calitu,1,,"The fact that someone can just spawn right next to you while you're exposed and insta kill you, makes it really cheap. Also, not as advertised in the Facebook video, false advertising."

Paper.io2,Maya Zidan,4,,"It's a fun game but the only problem is that many glitches always appear and signs saying I lost when I just started the game IN MY COLOR, please fix this mistake"
Paper.io2,Keith T Great,2,10,Been playing a long time reset my phone so i could start over loved it so much. Unfortunately lately you die in your own territory all the time not sure if its server lag or what but very upset there is also no way to tell them there is a problem so from 5 stars to 2 and 1 of them is just because it use to be good
Paper.io2,Tanya MacNeil,1,4,This has to have the most ads. Some are back to back. I can barely play one round. The game is fun but this app sucks. Not worth it.
Paper.io2,Eli Cortez,1,3,This game isn't fun at ALL so many tiktok adds and when I took another life it just set me at spawn and so many glitches that killed me I wish I could rate this 0 stars. don't install if you don't like so many adds or touches this wasted my time such a waste of space
Paper.io2,R0SEIC,2,1,"There are so many ads! And all the ""people"" you're playing against are just bots... I understand you want to make money, but could you keep the ad stuff down please?"
Paper.io2,Abhay Singh,5,1,It's a good game and I am giving this game five stars because it has very fun üëåüëåbut there was one problem that is there was many adds are coming
Paper.io2,Delgado Williams,2,,I rate this a 2-star game because sometimes when you are a king/queen it takes a way your land and it's like it makes you go back where you started
Paper.io2,Alejandro Martinez,3,,Great game but it's impossible to win with these bugs. It would randomly erase your entire area at times.
Paper.io2,Oliver Storer,1,8,"The worst game out there, I had a damn advert in the middle of my screen when I was first and had 50% of the map. Mabye damn don't shove ads in your face during gameplay, and I don't wanna pay any money to your money hungry company."
Paper.io2,Damon Wilson,1,138,"If you start in the middle of the circle, you will die within a couple seconds. The ONLY thing you can do is take ground .01% at a time which makes for a boring game. ALL the competition are computers and will spawn right next to you and kill you. You can't do anything about it. Very disappointing."
Paper.io2,Ray Kinard,1,3,I have no idea what's happening. I seem to die randomly and then I watch an ad. Perhaps some instructions before first play? And less ads? Uninstalled.
Paper.io2,Andre M,1,4,Ads and lag. Ads and lag. Ads and lag. This game would be so much better if it didnt lag anytime you get more than 5% garbage
Paper.io2,Alicia Sanchez,4,1,Pretty entertaining. I like to use this in the restroom at work because it is quick and if an ad comes on it is about time I go back. Highly recommend.
Paper.io2,james fazzani,5,,"Great skins, great map, great game. One thing wrong is the fact that to earn the uni skin is to cover 100% of the map. This game still deserves a 5 tho"
Paper.io2,Squishy O'Hara,4,1,This game is really fun but I do think that there should be more to it like a kill part in your path And try to avoid it while taking land but it's a good game doesn't take a high IQ so great for kids üòÑ
Paper.io2,Sara Nam,5,1,"Simple and fun! Could do without the aggressive advertising which seems worse on my phone compared to my tablet, especially the adverts with gruesome murder scenes...not great for my child to see."
Paper.io2,Joe Green,1,7,"Unplayable - Dire Game starts, but literally *every time* I start on 0% and *every* other player is on 10% within 2-3 seconds. You're *only* playing bots which the game favours to absurd levels making the game unplayable. Uninstall - Wasted my time. Will avoid Voodoo apps from now on due to *relentless begging* for my personal data."
Paper.io2,Goji Berry,4,6,"This game is slow and wen i start playing the game i did not fail i just play the game it stops me i cant play this game without game over.this games is on a üëå half rated stars I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS GAME A LOT!!! Thank you, for reading this!!!"
Paper.io2,Saphira Beston,4,7,I absolutely love this game it's just that there is quite a few ads for me. But I just started playing and you only watch a ad every few games you play so I guess that's a bonus. I recommend this game 100%
Paper.io2,Tochukwu Elizabeth chikamso,4,2,I rate four star because I started playing it and that was because I saw it in an ad so when I lost I was just watching everyone else playing and losing but it's still great üòä. But paper.io 2 you can do better üòâüòÅ.
Paper.io2,Hoss Russel,3,4,Enjoyable as I'm getting stoned playing it. . It is annoying for the commercials but understandable. They only make you wait 8 seconds every time. Not too bad. At least i didn't have to open up my wallet.
Paper.io2,samikshha Puri,3,2,This game is not bad but can improve more . And ads after every game is there. I dont like it at all . üò§üò†üòù
Paper.io2,ArticFox 224,5,,I never get sick of this game! When I'm bored I can just go right to playing it and It's never been glitchy for me!
Paper.io2,Gaming Hero,1,,The moment you cover a higher percentage area the game will start hanging and like this many more promblem are there in this game........... Plsssss do not download this game this is a waste of time..
Paper.io2,Amber Karamat,3,,Not bad game but you should make the characters move a bit faster so you can get out of tricky situation.
Paper.io2,Ava Villarreal,4,4,"This game is very fun, but the adds are crazy! Story time: so I just started playing the game, and I went out of my little citcle starting place and this person just rams into me and I loose... Lol"
Paper.io2,Scott Detweiler,2,4,It's a good game... until suddenly you have no area and so you die. Very frustrating when you are up by 25% and suddenly you have 0. Going to delete and maybe check in a few months. Was so close to purchasing!
Paper.io2,AwkwardAlana,4,4,The controls are very easy to use and the skins are quite simple to unlock. There are a few ads but not too many like other apps. This game is simple and funüôÉüòÅ
Paper.io2,iicloudy,5,2,"I love paper.io! Theres nothing wrong with it. Barely any adds for me! Collect skins is hard.. My paper.io got deleted, i had so many skins! Thats a probelm that i want fixed, other wise, Its a amazing game!"
Paper.io2,Zuzanna Latanska,4,10,"Great game, Im addicted to it I can spend hours on it, really good quality. Yet maybe you could add a section where youcan chat with other players live and let other players socialise with each other. Thanks"
Paper.io2,Logan Malloni,2,1,The game is fun but its to hard. Ive been working on the police car skin for almost a year and im very mad at the game but i cant get 50% with 0 kills people keep taking my stuff while im trying to not kill them but they kill me
Paper.io2,Mike Mergel,5,,Its a fun game... but if you play u should have a lot of patience becoulse the game has a lot of bugs that nead to be cleaned:)
Paper.io2,Avabella Torchia,4,12,"Good game very fun and gets addictive, but you are also playing against bots, so i guess it cant be perfect, especially when there are 84 people by you when you start."
Paper.io2,Jeffery Ramsden,5,10,It is good but you cant run in your own line which is silly but I like it. if it had 1/10i would rate it a 10 I love this game. my family said it was hacked but I didn't trust them so I secratly downloaded the game.
Paper.io2,Kat Lines,3,3,"Very addictive game but suddenly started having problems, game starts off well then gets very glitchy, controls unresponsive, not running smoothly. Can't play at all when it's like this which is all the time."
Paper.io2,Angela Ilfrey,2,1,Would've given it 5 stars if the skins would unlock. I have been playing for 5 or 6 days in a row to unlock the burger or bus and it still says 0 days. Also got 15 sec out of my area but no mouse. Fix it and i will give 5 stars.
Paper.io2,Archief_WWNN,1,4,When I play it seems when I get to far in to it they spawn a bot near by to kill me and then its game over. So the only way to truly play is to install mods to balance it out since its unfair.
Munchkin.io,Erick Beard,1,2,"It's just a bunch of bots that either ignore you unless attacked, or follow you endlessly like a zombie movie and kill you by ganging up. The bots are extremely obvious and not at all fun to play against because they are extremely predictable. The controls are also very clunky."
Munchkin.io,NovaRanger,4,6,"This is what happens when 'BattleRoyale' and 'MOBA' have a secret affair, the baby is this game. Only thing I found bad is that anybody can enter private rooms even with password protected.. also the map is pretty large.."
Munchkin.io,LORENZO,5,15,"Awesome It is really fun to play. Running around and killing people. Maybe you can improve more by adding new maps. Skills, animations and stuff. You get the point. Keep it up."
Munchkin.io,Jason Pike,5,16,"Great game for sure. Basic gameplay much like a lot of .io games (mooch around a level, hoovering up all the dots you can to advance your level) but this game does it better than most. Lots of characters, in3 different classes, with a lot of customisation options (outfits, weapons and abilities) to keep you well busy. What I like the best though, and this is very rare indeed of late, is you can play without spending a penny, and compete with players who chose to spend. No ad badgering either. So"
Munchkin.io,Matthew Coy,2,5,"the game flat out lies about pvp which, in my opinion, is pretty much all you need for a 1* review. gameplay is otherwise ok. I like the idea, though it's not so original. the main problem aside from lying is how the enemy will gang up on you like a mob regardless if you're the leader or just starting the round. it gets pretty silly."
Munchkin.io,ScarletSiren,4,6,"I enjoyed it then quickly got bored. I have only been playing with bots and they're nowhere near challenging. I max out my level in a matter of minutes and don't know what else to do after that. At the very least, more human players are needed. And at most, more leveling up for your character in-game."
Munchkin.io,Ali Dellapina,5,30,honestly. I'm not one to review games this game is different than others the cartoonish characters are fun and have a rag doll like quality it let's you pick between 3 instead of find the items randomly like in others. it depends on your main or your warrior. the mains are really different and well thought out. its extremely addictive the second you die you wanna go back in and get your revenge!!! it's a small game but worth it oh did I mention No ads? yeah theres no ads.
Munchkin.io,Tyler Callis,4,4,"When there is a communication error, the button says ""yes"" on the notification box. Please change to ""okay"" or ""Try again"". Also skills like intimidation cast faster than others. And some skills feel extremely slow or useless because you have to push the skill button like 5 times to cast it. This is a big issue that makes the game feel 1 sided and pointless to try sometimes. Also the cast timer for first aid should be (1.00-(x) where x is equal to attack speed or add a update and add a skill cast speed to each character."
Munchkin.io,Neal Williams,3,10,"Enjoyable and entertaining. Can lose hours or even entire weekends to this simplistic yet addicting game... Although there are way too many ads for my tastes. Eliminate the ads, or at the very least, reduce the amount of ads, and I will update this review to 5 stars."
Munchkin.io,Bill Bo,1,5,"I was really enjoying this game, Ben playing for a couple months now. what fun I did find is gone. for a month now I haven't seen any other players whatsoever. regaled of time of day or night, it seems the game had died. as well as the tanning tier is full of high scores yet no one is ever on... lame."
Munchkin.io,Mephisto,1,183,"this game is full of bots. they NEVER attack each other, but ALWAYS attack me !!! and the boss monster also only attacks me even though there was another players (or bots) around. so in this game, the sole enemy is me !!! me !!! and ME ONLY !!! pretty much makes the game a total garbage. uninstalled. P.S.: why did the Editor even chose this game is beyond me."
Munchkin.io,chiinawa a,5,131,One of the better games I've played on the app store. I like building up my character in this way. However as alot of reviewers say.. There does seem to be alot of bots. But I think that is due to a small player base... More humans playing in general means less bots.. So I hope more people come to play because I highly recommend.
Munchkin.io,Aidan Shillin,5,1,"Fun game, wish I could change up my talents when max level though, it would create more oppenings for people to slip up (changing in mid battle since you have to be on a different screen thus rendering you open to attack). the tides could quickly change but also gives players thr chance to fiddle around with game mechanics. id like to see clan enabled stuff"
Munchkin.io,Chris Meyer,4,,"I like a game like this. It's pretty cool. It's easy and enjoyable. Time killer, I'm rate it a 4 because it said liked it lol I can't say I loved it, it's not like the most awesome game out there but it's fun and enjoyable"
Munchkin.io,A Google user,5,1,"Very cool game, but it got worse when I realized that you have the option to play with A.I or solo with people but then you fins out the solo with people is just battle with smarter A.I, they don't attack you until you attack them and they do not run away when they are one hit killed."
Munchkin.io,Brandon Weiss,3,20,It's fun but way to pay to win. Players run around in high lvl gear and team up on you in a unfair fight. Even if you get the crown good luck keeping it. Also two handed swords are way to o.p. they trump high lvl axes hammers and reg swords. The wizard class is to slow and weak and ranged is nice but if you get cornered your done.
Munchkin.io,brianna napoles,1,8,I used to LOVE playing this game. I've even made plenty of purchases. Now for some odd reason the game will no longer run on my device. HELP!
Munchkin.io,Havok,4,18,The game is great but...I was wondering if you can add a campaign mode and have clans in the game as well. I also think the game would be better if there was a global chat or whatever so other players can talk to each other. Please consider this idea and I hope you add it to the game!
Munchkin.io,Rolly M,2,5,"03/23/19 pretty good game, except getting absolutely massacred by players in a few hits. like to know how players get so strong so fast?? would like to see a level cap increase over lvl 16. or at least level up past 16 to refill health and mana. also absolutely NEED to have more than 3 classes. still having fun, at least having fun against bots anyways. 09/02/19 and NOW the game won't even load, uninstalling!"
Munchkin.io,Lorenze Ocobillo,4,15,"This is a great game! good start but needs improvements. I experience lag/delay during gameplay while having a good internet connection. I suggest to INCREASE crown level as honor increases. Add more equipment, class, skills, and other features! Looking forward for these improvements! Good Job!"
Munchkin.io,Damien,3,5,"Great Game, lots of bugs...many of the challenges don't unlock even though you completed the conditions. Last, it appears as though what they claim is pvp is actually A.I. as the intelligence/skill of the players is severely lacking"
Munchkin.io,Joshua Lucas,5,42,Love the game! Its a very relaxex take on battle royal type games. Very easy to be good at. 5 stars all around. Ps jf your having a hard time getting stronger in game my advice is to collect the blue blobs on the ground. They give you exp and make your little fighter stronger.
Munchkin.io,Darryl Hardin,2,2,"The game is highly P2W and I consistently get shot out of screen, which seems odd. Maybe they are on tablets and I'm on phone so they have a better view of everything, but is still frustrating. Cosmetics, which is where P2W comes in in an obvious way, increase your stats."
Munchkin.io,alt knight,2,19,good concept bad execution.takes whats fun about arrow.io and scrambles it up with this mess. most of the skills are awful you never know if they are going to work or.not. worst hack and slash.mechanics ive ever played there are so many bugs that the game feels completely random and unfluid. is this skill going to work or.not this time or is a lvl 1 going to somehow kill me in 2 hits as I slashing on him for 15 seconds uninterrupted. so with incredibly bad server and bugs everywhere rate 2*
Munchkin.io,4N4RCHY,3,3,Would totally be 5 stars. But if they want my money they need to merge the last tiers to the same servers. Theres litterally nothing but bots when you reach lvl 7. Its just not nearly as fun now. But I have hope they will fix this.
Munchkin.io,Yami Hime,3,,The game was super cool and easy to lear but the thing is the gap of the power between the ranged characters vs the melees is way off if you could accept this criticism it would be nice for us players and your game will definitely improve stay positive and keep up the good work devs
Munchkin.io,TheChronichabitz,4,13,actually a really great .io game if not the best. worth a download. my only issue is there seems to be no challenge on here... perhaps a lack of good players. also the mechanics aren't exactly super smooth.
Munchkin.io,who are you? WHO AM I?!,1,,The game is literally botted proof? Well 1.enemies attack you when you are in bushes (hiding spots where you can use healing abilities without enemies disrupting you) 2. I HAD ABSOLUTELY THE WHOLE SERVER AFTER ME 3. The enemies have some wierd buggy walk thats how you mostly identify bots and well thats it for nowi have uninstalled the game and probably wont come back to it
Munchkin.io,zeyele,2,,"When you have a global pvp server where one can be 10x the level of the rest there is no point in even trying. This game is perfect if you want to feel you are a big boy, but that's all there is to it. A place to express ones complexes..."
Munchkin.io,Zillion Hill,1,8,"The game isn't balence Percentage off win if u pick fighter = 60%-70% always win again mage and archer Mage = only 30% off win the game if u have the strongest spell, the mage spell should be stronger and faster tu cast, cos u have no change to win again fighter that have stun n dash + fast attact if they have dual sword. Archer = 0% change , the attack speed of archer should be fast cos they don't have spell that useful enough"
Munchkin.io,Zach Baker,1,18,"I give this 1 star in hope the Dev will see it. I have a Note 8, a phone in which can handle anything and everything at the moment and this game simply doesnt get past the title screen. I am goi g to keep the app in hope of an update soon. Please help, I'd love to try and play this game to support. It looks fun."
Munchkin.io,Darryl spease,4,15,Love this game but starting to see to many people that can't take damage. Kinda takes the fun out. Otherwise this game is awesome. I'll keep playing till it's completely overrun with it.
Munchkin.io,John Smith,5,,‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Please add a bit knockback upon being hit (to be more realistic) & please add Offline mode too
Munchkin.io,James Sahuaqui,3,1,"i like the game but not enough real players and i had been playing the game for a few hours and had over 700 coins 200+kills and at the end of my game it didnt guve me any thing for all that time i played ,um sooooo mad at the game right now,(would of gave it a better reveiw)"
Munchkin.io,Dale Littlejohn,4,2,awesome game mad fun and tons of characters and equipment would be cool if characters had their own skills tho . The bots are super lame aswell is ur game just that dead that you have to flood with bots or is this a matchmaking issue... please fix and I will 5 star
Munchkin.io,Wobbles Cow,5,1,Amazing. Simply wonderful. Welcome to the IO game that doesnt make the max level so powerful that they are invincible. Awesome game I' cant wait to finish this review and get back in a match :)
Munchkin.io,Max Collazos,3,1,"It's fun to play, but the last match I was in seemed like most were running bots with the invincible shield just running a path back and forth and only one would chase you and attack."
Munchkin.io,Jason Hallett,4,2,"I really like the game, but alot of the time I struggle to find real players so I just fight the Ai which is fine, but they're so useless that it makes it unenjoable after I get to the crown level, I would give it 5 star if you make the Ai more challenging"
Munchkin.io,Vann Jesz,3,1,"it's a good game actually. the problem is with the bots, please work more on them. I'd like to play it when it's more polished than this. Ppl will love it. Wp"
Munchkin.io,K-9 T-rexTM,3,,Game is quite simple and good. but why there is no time limit in single mode match? how far should I go to win that? Give the players some goal to win a match.though the Game gave me an opportunity too early to criticise it. How about a Brwal mode?
Munchkin.io,Aphexio,3,4,"I played the game once and I loved it, but when I turned the game off and turned it on later, I was stuck on the loading screen! Please fix this, or tell me how to fix this if the problem has happened with other players."
Munchkin.io,A Google user,1,26,This is useless when your on the top spot your gonna be haunted by the bots or ai and their even faster to lvl up than me and they wont let me escape until I die their trying to kill me ahh if you remove that and just let them fight one by one this game would be a thousand times better so please remove that feature
Munchkin.io,Neis Raka,5,1,"Please upgrade connection because in country indonesia still lagging connection or stuck from start click application,and after match end want to go home usually stuck ,,, im using wifi at home with speed connection 10mbps still like that ,i hope develop can fix it thank you"
Munchkin.io,Preston Osborne,5,1,I am absolutely loving this game! It is easy and extremely enjoyable. I'd recommend maybe adding a new map at some point or maybe put a duel arena or team mode
Munchkin.io,Bennit Marko,1,6,"Take a good look at the terms before you agree. States plainly that they will use not only your, but anyone else info that happens to be in your phone, however they wish. Not cool. I'm surprised and a little outraged that it is editors choice."
Munchkin.io,Lully Pawp,2,8,Fix your servers. It's an enjoyable game but more often than not I do not get my rewards after I die because the game just refuses to load them in. It's irritating because I can't earn money or finish quests because the game just stops after I die.
Munchkin.io,Jeffrey Schaeffer,4,,"Like the game a whole lot but my only complaint is it gets boring after awhile , not enough modes to try , n anytime i try playing the ballgame it never can find enough of the ten players to start a game"
Munchkin.io,Chris Nangle,4,4,"great game. connection can vary a little, i assume its a matter of distance between the host player and the rest, so that could be tweaked a little. but seriously fun little battle royale."
Munchkin.io,Jon Jon,1,3,Would be great if u could actually pvp. Been playing for 2 weeks now and ive seen 1 other player. Tried setting up private rooms and people i know who play cant even see it
Munchkin.io,Absolute Zero,4,46,"Awesome game. No forced ads, great gameplay, and not that many bugs. Would recommend. Just dont like the chest system, and how we have to reach lv 2 to find players"
Munchkin.io,WrathOfTheLegend,5,,Really good Game my only complaint is the rewards from chest they suck . spend like 1000+ coins on chest and my characters have alright gear definitely not the best kept getting duplicates over and over .
Munchkin.io,Jedrek Angelo Tupas,1,10,"the game is full of bots, and most of them will keep on chasing you even if there are other targets. complete trash, you wont even enjoy playing because of this"
Munchkin.io,Crusenho Agus Hennihuno,4,2,"This is really good and fun, but some how I feel I play with NPC with fake nicknames and not the real player. Please improve the game more approachable and real."
Munchkin.io,Paulo Miguel Valdez,3,8,"I'm playing this game, ""in-game"" I killed 234 players, I get 300+ gold already, when A player killed me I'm going to resurrect..but the system says connection error problem while my internet connection is 50mb/sec..the gold and score did not credit when i relog"
Munchkin.io,Silkitte Hawke,1,7,"The game very lagging and not stable for sure... The game fun but the connection bad - I play real fine in other game - also that's strange with lvl, since low lvl can kill high lvl even they just lvl 3 - but what I hate the most is bunch of bot trying to killed me not one by one"
Munchkin.io,WhatUk Gaming,3,14,I liked the game ..its good.. But what im seeing right now after reinstalling the game... I cant get my data back.. I linked my account but still it didnt gave me my data back... So i guess i lost it...and i cant even put my nick name as it is saying its in use already So please
Munchkin.io,Mariku Junrei,5,,"Great game just needs a bigger player base, animations could be a little smoother, perhaps some controller support and more diverse levels would attract more players"
Munchkin.io,Steven Smith,2,2,"You have players hacking your game, players cannot stay invisible for an entire game, there's no skill or character that allows it... Fix it."
Munchkin.io,Duane Hickman,4,16,this game is fun but the game needs in game chat. emotes are a start but do we really need the charaters to dance and nod? i say take that out of the game and replace it with the in game chat. also this game is way 2 grindy for such a small player base
Munchkin.io,Shook McCook,4,1,"Pros- -Cute characters -Customization -Not pay to win -Variety of weapons and skills Cons- -The art style may not appeal to everyone -Only one map -Got 50+ kills in first place, gets nothing to show for it cuz of a currency earnings cap üò¨"
Munchkin.io,Heaven Sent,3,,"game is fun and good.. thats all.. chest opening takes to long, 4 chest 1 at a time? why cant we just open them all.. thats my only problem aside from it ai infected, cant match with players"
Munchkin.io,Ted Josiah Paragas,4,1,Can sometimes have slow loading time sometimes even having errors. I'm on Asia server and at early times gameplay was fine but soon every match involved lag. But I enjoyed it because the controls and gameplay feels like a moba.
Munchkin.io,Damir S,1,21,"Another game with bots(AI), I'll just keep giving you 1 star because you never make any changes when it comes to online battles..... it's always the same concept (which I don't mind) with bots."
Munchkin.io,Spencer Jackson,5,3,"Amazing, just love this game. It needs a way to add friends, and maybe a clan style option as well. Keep up the good work."
Munchkin.io,killos millhowd,5,16,To the people who play this game there are real people me and my friend played in the same match many times ps. Love the game also you guys should make duel matches and privet matches to invite your friends into a match keep up the good work!!
Munchkin.io,Marzuq Imran,5,,"One of the must have game. But the control for the archer skill should be change to auto target, as it is very hard to use them"
Munchkin.io,Chaldean Alkemist,5,5,the game is really cool and would be funner with actual ppl and less laggy-ness. hopefully there are characters without lvl cap and their own personal skill. the ai and bosses shud progressively get better
Munchkin.io,Mark Dennis Sta.Maria,5,3,Awesome gameplay. Decent graphics. Has a lot of potential. Please do not make it a pay to win game.. ^_^
Munchkin.io,Dean Maloney,1,12,"Would be an absolutely amazing game if there were actually other people to play against and not just ai , I've literally played for the past week and haven't seen a single real person, it's a shame this game would be so much fun."
Munchkin.io,Yeah Bro,5,1,"I love it so much but please add more weapons,armor and everything add more mobs to"
Munchkin.io,Phyzik Time,3,3,The game is ok but i cant seem to find any real players. Always playing with bot that doesnt attack unless if they were attacked. I only found 2 real player so far.
Munchkin.io,Frarly,5,2,"Very fun time killer with different characters, weapons and abilities to keep you busy! Runs smoothly."
Munchkin.io,J Hatcher,4,1,"Good game if you like battle royals games and killing. The reason why I didn't eat 5 stars is because if you are max level or if you have the crown, you regen pretty slowly and level 3s can kill you."
Munchkin.io,Eenie Meanie,3,4,"the only functional server is South Korea. if you find players, they'll be overpowered af, so enjoy that. every other game mode and server is 100% bots."

Munchkin.io,Brian Gorley,4,,I like this game but there are way to many bots and it takes the fun out of the game I would rather play with real people but besides that it looks nice and is a lot of fun
Munchkin.io,B Clownin,3,3,I want to like this game. But just ran into a few games where I'm left in a 1v1 in BR and the last guy is outside the circle attacking the npc's while I die to circle.
Munchkin.io,TripleXposed,3,,Nice game. But im having problem when i die it wont respawn unless i terminate the whole application. Maybe because its new there a lot need to fix.
Munchkin.io,Bryan Taylor,5,1,"I would like to see a level cap raise! And possibly some for of capture the flag or similar, teamwork game mode!"
Munchkin.io,Marigoulas,1,2,The game as an idea is not bad...but there aren't any real players in it..its just frustrating having 6-7 bots chasing you around while they dont even bother fighting each other...just BAD
Munchkin.io,Nug get,1,4,"Pay to Win , p2w player most of them is bully. its fun at first level novice league , but when reach expert league you will meet p2w player and it ridiculously OP , when spawn they already lv7 and have epic skill dont Download this game, let it die"

FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,King Harris,3,49,"Eve & Freestyler supposed to be obtained by watching ads, yet it's been couple of weeks it's saying ""video not available"". It's not much as online gaming. It lags at times. Reviving by ads are random & not giving after the 1st time being KO on each one. 0 power-ups. Seem like a fun game but the replay value decrease over time as the game become an app generator. If no changes, I must uninstall."
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Happy doggo,2,66,"The knock-back is broken, characters and controls are un-intuitive and unbalanced, shown in the horrible controls, and any sense of fun is only minuscule. Even when knocked back AND stunned for the whole 2.5 seconds, you can still take damage. This game had the potential to be great, but a variety of problems-which could all be easily fixed, by the way-make it very bad."
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Liam Sanchez,1,18,"You know, this game is actually good and I can recommend it. I only gave it 1 star because of the following: 1.) Low FPS rate. Maybe it's just for me but the frame rate is too low. I recommend making a settings for this game, it would really help a lot. 2.) The ‚ÄúRage‚Äù ability doesn't work, and it's not just for me, but it's for everyone who download the game. You should really fix this since it's one of the best abilities and the ability that most of us worked hard to get but didn't get to use."
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Ricky Bobby,4,13,Make the characters level up. Or add power ups. The game play itself is awesome. Simple but effective.
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Armored Mech,2,,Fix the rage i cant hit the enemy unless its infront of me i cant hit if the enemy so close to me
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,NooBita,4,4,"Nice game but my problem is the control, speed and sensitive. I wish next update will fix this situation"
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,John Pillay,3,5,Its a great game but the bots aren't challenging enough. Please make an online version. I'd like to Mike Tyson some people
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Jon Jamora,4,,The game is fun but why is only added 4 stars is because why am i watching an add if i didnt wanted to? pls fix this
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Luk e,2,5,Its a pretty good game but I give it 2 because it has sooo many adds. after every game which is about 1 to 10 minutes you have to watch about 20 seconds of add and find yourself getting really bored.
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,dragonslayz,4,9,Game super fun I love how you get to juke the punches of your opponents the combo them but the reason I put 4 stars is because I hate it when a person with a ability of the spin it's too OP my idea is to take off the knockback time for that ability thanks great game!!
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Angel alt,5,17,Extremely fun game but would love it if you added live time multilayer I can tell it's not online as when I open the multi screen witch forces it to pause everything freezes until I go back like and after I go back everyone's at the positions they were in but this game is amazing
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,HENG On,5,2,"Love it, the fact is i was addicted to it as it is such a great game, except for the ads which is super annoying. But overall, excellent!"
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,sarksesful djet,1,3,You need to connect to the internet and watch ads to get characters...whenever i try to get a character no videos are available...facepunch:uninstalling
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Frank Carrol,2,77,I know as a free game advertising is necessary but after every game you are forced to watch 1-3 adverts. If it was after every 3 or 4 games I was given a advert I give this a better rating
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Leonila Lanestosa,5,,"this game was great so amazing skills and i so i live it,.. hope this game was improve and more maps!"

FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Fantastic AJ,4,26,It is great! But i gave it a 4 star cause the ads! UNSTOPPABLE ADS. But its the greatest one. With Rblx and ML also ;)
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Xitroe Kun,1,1,"As a free game its likely it would have ads witch is fine but, the ads in this game is too out of hand."
FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,game trigger,2,,"Should make in more communicating with others in the world and more skins more achievements and level ups,but instead this game is dieing everyday"

FacePunch.io Boxing Arena,Pamela Rallos,5,,ilove des game
Push'em all,Heather Eagle,4,51,"One of the most addictive games I've played. I could play for an hour and not realize. I just wish the game wouldn't lag so much because of the ads. I have to play on airplane mode to enjoy it. When playing online (which I do sometimes to get more coins from missions or to spin the weapon wheel again), the app randomly closes. I also wish that the sound effects were different for each weapon, and that there was some cool background music."
Push'em all,Kim Williams,5,1437,"Great game. Love it. So heres the deal with the ads people.... when an ad comes on the screen, just hit the home button on your phone and press the game app again. The ads skips immediately and brings you right back to where you were. The game doesn't close out. You dont have to let the ads play in their entirety. Game makers...we need an aerial view of each level !!!!! Love the green rocket launcher. I can clear a board without leaving home base.üòÑ"
Push'em all,Josiah Animations,2,217,"Listen, I absolutely love this game, but there is so many ads, and it's super laggy. I can't tell you how many times I've kept going forward and off the edge even though I turn around or let go. There are many problems about this game, personally I think we should be able to choose are own weapon. I'd really like to see this game add more enemies and more maps, slot of the maps are either repeats or reskins."
Push'em all,First name Last name,2,116,"Okay, so the graphics are meh, the controls are unresponsive, continuous ads for the same game, and very bad advertising. I'm just gonna say it, this is probably one of Voodoo's better games, but how this game is advertised is very bad. I've seen ads for this game where at the top it says, ""I can't reach pink color"", when the NPCs are all pink!"
Push'em all,Kylo's Korner,5,680,"I've played this game for several weeks. It's great for casual play. You can play for a couple hours or a couple minutes. It's just challenging enough to stay fun. You earn and cycle through multiple weapons. Some weapons are definitely better than others. You don't have to spend a penny to enjoy it. It has the usual ads, but nothing excessive. It does rarely freeze up and crash during ads."
Push'em all,J√ºrgen Henze,4,5,"Nice casual time waster with offline earning capability. As with other games from Voodoo, the annoying nag and beg Textline is present and must be clicked away every time one wants to play. Apart from impolite in-game ADnoyance, game plays well offline,weapons are creative and until now no glitches have been found."
Push'em all,Oliver Carranza,4,368,"The game is good, it's fun, I like it. It would be amazing if there were new level designs, new opponents, or new features. I like to play this in my free time and i enjoy much. Although it does get boring at times since the levels are repeats and their is only four opponents. I hope the developers add new features as this game is great."
Push'em all,jutmooo yes,1,59,"This game was great. After every level instead of asking to show an ad or trading, it just strait forces you to. To me these types all belong in a particular category. This game sadly showcases other games in such a heavy handed way that i doubt the game is even relevant. It sole purpose is to trick you. Every successful phone game has the ads tailored in a none invasive way, so that the person can play a game and not get anxiety while doing so. The greed in this one is strong."
Push'em all,Laine Rednour,2,,It's a shame that this game messes up constantly. It would be a great game otherwise. Ticks me off that it won't stop&jus keeps walking right off the side of the building even thoy I'm taping my phone (too hard at times)to try and stop em to no avail......smh please fix&I'll hit ya with 5‚≠ês
Push'em all,zulhusnaa maisarahh,3,89,"I really like this game,it is fun and addictive.But after a few days and I was trying to open the game and play as usual,it shows me the blue screen with numbers at the top.I cannot do anything when I'm stuck there.I exited,and reboot my phone.I open the game back to check if there's progress,but it shows me the same.I tried so many times but the result is same.The other games in my phone works fine as well,this is the only game that I can't open.Gonna uninstall now."
Push'em all,Matt Smith,2,150,"After enjoying the game and it's rewards for a few months ( lots of earned in game items) the game crashed so hard - I had to reinstall and lose everything. That was strike 1. Everytime I knock out challenges - I opt to watch the ads to boost the reward - however - the ads you can watch to boost ANYTHING - are always, yes always, unavailable; but, when you get to a new section - an ad plays everytime and you cannot skip I like this game for a time waster - but fix it. It comes off as dishonest"
Push'em all,Solo Comics,2,428,"A another lazy game made by VOODOO. I'm not shocked. A lot people on the reviews were pretty angry because of ads. Of course there's going to be ads in a game because money! The controls of this game are slippery. And why the wheel for some reason? Can we just choose our own weapon? That will be more easier than just the wheel. I honestly wasted my whole time playing this game. There are more better games than this, that are not lazy and can do way more better."
Push'em all,angel Cyran,2,243,Fun game and i really enjoy playing but once I got to level 86 its glitching and shutting down almost every level. Its annoying and has me about to delete the game and download someone else's that's not glitchy. There are tons of ads but I'm ok with that if the game didn't glitch and shut down every 30 seconds. Fix the bug and i would rate 5*.
Push'em all,Ryan,1,70,"Ads between levels are acceptable, but ads popping up to cover half the screen during game play, that can't be exited or minimized is not. That ruins the game and makes it u playable when you can't see your character or enemies because of a huge ad in the middle of the level taking up your screen."
Push'em all,Macie McKeel,5,91,"I love this game. Only have one issue with it...I think there needs to be an option where we can choose our weapon. I really don't like a lot of the weapons and its frustrating when the wheel constantly picks the ones I don't like. Other than that, this game is amazing and I play it a lot to relieve stress."
Push'em all,The Strategies,5,105,"Game is good but after reaching certain level everything is same as before. Reached about level 800 (eight hundred), Repeated again and again. Need changes. Change in background change in weapons and change in enemy. With more power. Rest this game is good."
Push'em all,Jandemo Ngullie,5,33,"It's simple, fun, and amazing but you can add a shop to buy different types of weapons and skins for this game like the stick, your first ever weapon. You can also evolve it."
Push'em all,YoungTaek Hwang,5,24,"The push is funny but sometime l can lost my and i can everytime i love push'em all is so lovely then i thot and i give five star! I play push'em all a lots already. When i fell the push'em all give me one chance and now is much,much, much,much,much better and last time is not better at all but now is much,much, much,much,much better!"
Push'em all,Daniel Vargas Sanchun,4,14,"1. Candy cane is very inconsistent, not fun to play 2. Invisible enemies glitch 3. Upgrade buttons are easy to push and when youre trying to save for cosmetics it becomes annoying to lose money withouth even knowing After this the game is a fun experience and I will keep playing it"
Push'em all,Talking Silence,4,3,"This is an interesting game... the characters are so cute, even my friends admire this game... I like this... The only problem is I cant change my weapon easily, I still need to watch the ads..."
Push'em all,Jermaine Mayers,5,13,"A very entertaining game, though, you should be able to choose which weapon you want without having to watch a video, and, there should be an option for you to exit to the home screen. Just my opinionüòä"
Push'em all,Elizabeth Phelps,4,4,This game is fun however the levels are repetitive. You go through the same obstacle course every level. It gets monotonous. Other than that would have been 5 stars
Push'em all,Bill Dunlap,5,2,"Freezes once in a while. Controls stick now and then and you walk off a cliff. But it's fun, just a few commercials."
Push'em all,Bryce Steen,3,3,Very fun gameplay. Very addictive. However not much variety in level design and AI. Shouldn't lock players to specific weapons and have the time weapon switch add never works.
Push'em all,Vinoth Thangaraj,1,11,"Uninstalled immediately after installation ones I saw the agreement page. Agree to collect my personal data to play some 3rd rated stupid # game? No, thank you. I hate advertisements, why would I need targeted advertisements."
Push'em all,Abbi C,4,,The only thing I wish was different was that you had a choice of spinning the wheel because sometimes if like to stick with the normal one.
Push'em all,Kay Samuels,5,3,This game is very good it doesn't have any ads for like 3 rounds and it's fun to play you can choose firffent weapons my favorite is the gin I can shoot them but from a distance. It's a good game
Push'em all,Enrico Fanelli,1,13,"The game is nice, however there are way too many ads and way too many trackers hidden within. You fell? You can either: watch an ad and restart from that point or restart (and still forced to watch and ad). After each map: ad. You breathe: ad. Absolutely embarassing, this game is a nice time killer however the experience is completely ruined by all this ads. If I play in airplane mode however it becomes a quite enjoyable game."
Push'em all,Haytham Aly,1,2,"Very bad controls, very poor graphics and lots of ads starting after 30 seconds of playing, it's a total waste of time."
Push'em all,Shinu 45,4,13,"Push'em all is really satisfying game, it has a very funky countroes but the game play will really satisfy u. In it there are variety of weapons to push the zombie kind which are really awesome."
Push'em all,SKS YUGO,4,16,It's a good game but the sound level is way too low. The rare but very loud adds make it impossible to play with the sound on.
Push'em all,Pamela Barber,4,,It's been good I just started playing. It is hard to control a little bit. I play on my phone so I try to hold my finger back so I can see my man but it is hard at times.
Push'em all,sajda sultana,4,9,Very nice game I have been playing this game a lt lately fun app good for time pass but u really need to reduce some ads. Overall my experience with this game has been very goodüëç
Push'em all,Kia Vang,2,7,Horrible Laggy ass game! Crashes all the time and is unplayable! It works once in a while and it's really good until it crashes and lags! The ads are forever and the game is so short!
Push'em all,A Ham,1,,Too many ads. One or two between EVERY LEVEL. Too many for me.
Push'em all,MK,1,1,Ad playing time is more than actual gameplay time. I wonder if this game is actually a game or just an advertising medium for that stupid annoying WeTV app
Push'em all,Laltluangkima Hmar,1,12,"By far the worst game I've ever played. There's an add while your playing the game, not only in between every level or whatever, literally while playing the game. I'm deleating it right this moment, wish there was a negative star rating, I'd be happy to give negative 100 stars. THIS GAME SUCK BECAUSE OF THE ADDS. BTW just beg I u needed the money soooooo much, Give 1 star so that i can post this review"
Push'em all,Bonnie Clyde,5,5,Omggggshh!! I love this damn game.(Ad-free of course lol)I sit and literally play and play and my kids live watching me play it. 10 stars! Specially ad-free version.
Push'em all,k√∏ala m√∏chi .-.,5,,Its fun but to many ads but over all its an amazing game i luv it hope the updates (if there is)get fun for us!!
Push'em all,Mahesh Gaikwad,3,8,"I have completed almost 500 levels. I didn't see any challenging level so far. Just weapons are chaging after 5 levels but have same levels repeated again and again which makes it boring. To skip ads, you can play game by turning off internet connection üòÇ. If found one glitch in game that if you like any weapon and you want it in every level then you have to stop game when that wheel comes in picture and starts spinning. I used rocket weapon more than 200 levels without changing ü§£"
Push'em all,Beth Fawcett,1,3,You lost me after 3 rounds. The round lasts about 5 seconds and there's a 15 second ad after every single round. Already done with it.
Push'em all,shuqin chen,1,12,When I'm doing a power up I can't move and I keep on loseing the power up made me want to smash my phone :(((((( Bad game!!! And path is so thin I keep getting pushed off!!! The item is so hard to control!!! :((((((((((
Push'em all,Charles Freeman,4,12,"Complete all around great game, i enjoyed the graphics and non freezing features. Please make more as such, thanks."
Push'em all,Imran arif,5,,This is a good app but their is one bad thing about this app it is there are many adds after each game their is a add but no problem some adds are helpfull
Push'em all,debbie keele,1,468,The adds are annoying. They come 2 at a time. No way to make the sound off . Some of them have the sound icon to mute most of them dont . Had to turn off the sound ou f the phone . And every level you complete u have to watch the video adds ...the levels are very easy and not challenging so u end up dealing with adds more than playing ...not fun at all.
Push'em all,E M,1,9,I was on level 100 then after a few days when I opened the app I was on level 1. What the heck did just happen????
Push'em all,harry f,1,14,To many commercials. Will not buy under false claims of free followed by a saturation of commercials. Make it a paid app. Not worth playing. Dont support apps that force payment.
Push'em all,Darlene Denend,1,2,The game is very fun but the ads take up half of the phone screen so it makes it very unpleasant to play. I uninstalled within 3 days.
Push'em all,Niharika Acharya,3,765,It was fine but the interest was low for me and there were too many ads. They distracted me very much and did not allow me to play the game properly. I enjoyed the first few levels because it did not give me ANY ads but when I was at level 4 it started rushing all these ads. The ads is my only complaint. I would have recommended this game if it had fewer ads.
Push'em all,Scott McCormick,3,3,Fun game great time killer but it keeps kicking out and stopping. Need to get the bugs worked out.
Push'em all,Sorsha Mooncake,1,724,"Game is super fun and satisfying on airplane mode. Literally unplayable with the ads you get on internet. Literally. Unplayable. If you can't make money on the merit of your game and you have to have SO MANY ADS that your game becomes impossible to play, you fail. I know you don't care about failing and just want quick ad money from suckers, and you still get paid even when we install them angrily uninstall, but we hate you."
Push'em all,rehman shah,1,251,"All about the ads. Great game, and would addictive too if the ads didn't interrupt the game all the time. I'm used to ads after a level, but this game gives you an ad after a level, then during the level and again at the end. Ruins the game. Dont download it, unless you like ads more than a game."
Push'em all,Jadon Baldwin,4,479,"Overall, this is a pretty good time killer. People are too harsh on the ads, I think. There are a lot, but turning off wifi/data takes them all out without ruining gameplay. I agree with some other people that there could be more variety in the levels, but I like to play when I need something to for a few minutes. Takes the mind off Corona and the news, too üòÇ"
Push'em all,Twin Sisters,5,,I love this game it is very nice game there is few ads not annoying I hope you enjoy the game.
Push'em all,Jenniffer Moore,2,3,"I've made it to level 1843. I enjoy the game, but it's starting to become really repetitive. The same levels over and over again."
Push'em all,Robert Mullooly,1,5,"Shuts down the phone when you play this in airplane mode; or it will crash, wipe your progress forcing you to reinstall. It's a shame, the game had potential."
Push'em all,Devon Flynn,4,483,"The game is decent in and of itself. ive played about 210 levels and it doesnt get too boring. My biggest issue with the game is the air and water cannon. they should protect the front like every other weapon in this game does, rather than right side. they work fine on levels with thin platforms but god forbid you have a situations where enemies swarm you. ironically you guys didnt do the shoulder fire thing for the rocket launcher, the one weapon where it would make sense. But overall not bad."
Push'em all,Nadea White,5,150,Hello!!! So i pretty much love this game. Play it all the time. My whole house has this game downloaded!!! Im currently on level 720!!!!!! The only thing i dislike is...... The levels doesnt get challenging ... I stop getting weapons by level 100... I think that the levels should get harder. I think we should continue to get different weapons.... I think we should get more players. I follow all my mission and get them done but ive been doong that since the 1st game. Over all i enjoy playing it.
Push'em all,Haknne Cha,4,144,"Believe me, the ads on this game is not as bad as the 1 star reviews says it is. There are more games which have WAY more ads. The ads only appear once you reach a checkpoint (the following bridge you reach) and to me it's fine cuz it allows you rest your fingers for a while. Initially, rhe game is quite fun and addictive cuz you get new weapons after playing a number of rounds. But after getting all the weapons (6) it gets kinda boring cuz there no objective besides the missions."
Push'em all,Vickie Payne,5,340,I've been playing this game for months now and NEVER miss a day. Don't get me wrong. Some days I play for hours and other days I get annoyed because it beats me right off the bat and I end up just quitting right away but...I always go right back! It's a great game. It can be pretty challenging for sure but it's a game that keeps me interested. Always getting better...or at least I think I am anyway! Haha...one of my favorites for sure! Voodoo games are the best!
Push'em all,Kalysta Trelford,1,7,If you clicked on the ad for and thought oh looks like fun it is a little bit but there is an ad after every single round and it's not like in the ad where you got put in the middle of all the thingsand push mower away from the centre it's more complicated than that there's like these bridges that you have to go on and it's four so frustrating and you'll eventually fall off I would not get this game it is the worst game ever caught the graphics are horrible I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME üò†üò†üò°
Push'em all,Stephanie Franzen,1,,I really like this game but it keeps glitching and booting me out. Please fix!!
Push'em all,emiri davis,4,297,"This game is very addictive and honestly i can play for hours on end and lose myself in it. But one thing i really dislike is the Candy Cane weapon. It's useless and honestly just horrible! It doesn't push all the enemies off, it just spins them around and disperses them preventing us from getting our well deserved combo points. Just delete the candy cane weapon. Thanks."
Push'em all,Chris Colon,1,337,"""Contains Ads""? It should ""Contains a Game, maybe"". Began the first round, died went to an ad. Crossed a line and another ad over a minute long with no timer or ""x"" I had to close the game. This game by voodoo takes the cake on ads this is the equivalent of ordering a venti of milk w/ one shot of coffee and then calling it coffee w/ milk.....it's an ad-spree with a game break. Should be ashamed of yourselves Voodoo!"
Push'em all,navneet,1,81,I have given it 1 star...but..but..but .there is no problem with game...game is very funny.... But I think game is not designed to play...its there for only for showing adds....at each step you will find add....you play game for 15 second..and you will get 14 second add...next again play for 30 second..them again 20 seconds add...
Push'em all,Gerald Loranger,1,174,"Would be a fun game if it weren't for the adds. You need to watch adds for extra life's, if you say no to more lives you still need to watch an add, between levels another add, there's constant banner ads. and worst of all it will pause multiple times in the middle of a round for.....you guessed it. MORE F***ING ADDS."
Push'em all,N B,5,4,One of the absolute BEST game time to ad time ratio! The game is fun and a decent challenge.
Push'em all,Prasad Bhamre,3,,Nice concept .. funny and addictive game but motions for moving person in any angle is not feasible
Push'em all,Daniel Jungmayer,1,439,"It would be a great game but these ads are horrible when you get one after every level its annoying, but this game doesnt stop there it gives me one at the end of each level then one in the middle of the level too!! This would be a great game if it wasnt just trying to get money off of ads!"
Push'em all,Anja Popovic,1,350,"Where do I even start?This game is the worst from all your games, Voodoo. It has a ton of ads, even in middle of level!Your progress resets anytime you leave the game and decide to play it again the different day. When I die and want to continue, so I watch an ad-it makes me do that level over again, so its useless.You cannot pick your ""pusher"" or whatever you call it, you gotta play with what you get.No changes.If you want to experience ads, and not the game, this is a perfect app, 10/10, üëé"
Push'em all,Nikki R,4,834,"I love the game. As others said it is very addictive. The downfalls are it randomly crashes and I know it's about to because it will begin lagging and then closes out. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the tool wheel. I don't like that I cannot choose the weapon I want. The ads wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to watch it for anything you try to do. Spin the wheel to get a new weapon but can't because there are no ads available"
Push'em all,Elisa Chatt,1,3,Game was great until google ad pop ups placed themselves right in the middle of screen so j couldn't see where I was going! Pointless.
Push'em all,tenena lumen,5,1,Love this game. Great time killer. Too many ads though.
Push'em all,Jimmylah Knighten,1,476,"- No tutorial on how to use the weapons, have to figure it out yourself. - CONSTANTLY CRASHING (mostly with main spring weapon) - You can't pause the game - Not Google Play compatible - No personal choice of weapon, you have to spin a wheel for it. It'll also switch your weapons without your consent. - Many more issues but not enough characters. It's fun otherwise. Update: - Turns enemies invisible - Weapon lag Update: Level 2000 and it's not better. Pets pointless and freezes."
Push'em all,TANYA B.,5,100,I like this game because it's actually about trying to save your own life in the game. And also if this was real life and you had all these protections you can actually save yourself if you play this game. If you are really adventurous this is a good game for you to play because like I would have this game I'm venturous and I know that I can fight zombies and this game is about it. Who do not like this game. Well I'm not being rude about if you don't want this game but I think it's good. üòâüëçüèÜ
Push'em all,Madeline Ford,4,113,"I am really addicted to this game. The one issue I have is that if you lose a round you get moved to a whole different level and i hate that you can't choose your weapon. It spins and then you have to watch a video, but you still may not get the one you want. There are a few I like, but there are some that just don't work well for me."
Push'em all,Ashwin S,1,33,"Too many ads. Literally in the middle of playing. Like somone pointed out, if the developers had confidence in the game, they need not have to put so many ads. All ads I saw was 10sec intrusive video ads . It spoils the whole experience."
Push'em all,Sophie Hughes,4,143,"I'd rate this better if there was less ads. The gameplay is nice. The controls are simple and the game is well laid out. If your a calm person and don't mind ads then I think this is your game. Aside from the ads, it's fun and relaxing to me. If there's less ads I'll be happy to change this to 5 stars."
Push'em all,NS7 INFO CHANNEL,5,,Very good and interesting game... Keep it up... But i dont hear any sound or music
Push'em all,Farzana Akther,1,23,"I got over level 1100, however I changed my phone so I thought as I'm moving the game to my new phone without uninstalling it, the game level will stay the same. It made me restart all levels again so I'm really not that bothered to restart again. Every other game on my phone let me carry on with the levels I was already on except this."
Push'em all,andrew philpott,5,1,Easy game bit of fun upgrade from walking stick to rocket launcher can't figure out how to get back liked the walking stick
Push'em all,Steven Vanvelzor,1,365,"Wont lie, I like playing it but its horrible when it comes to the ads.....your in the middle of any level you play pushing them and than a ad starts....makes no sense why a ad would start when your in the middle of playing a level and its every level....so ya giving it a 1 since I cant do 0...uninstall and wont play it again till I see they fixed the ads in the middle of playing"
Push'em all,Nico C,1,134,"Avoiding this developer from now on. Second game I've tried from them and it is loaded with ads. Looked up their list of games and it's all easy, fun stuff with the same complaints of ads. The amount they make off ad spam must be good. That's their gimmick."
Push'em all,Lily Bic,5,2,when I downloaded this it made my dream come true. I've been playing it wherever I go. it's so fun that you can do waves and makes me feel excited‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòôüòôüòô you should download it too
Push'em all,MANSI PARIYA,5,,It is a very good game and it is very addicting. If I could give it a7 star I would.
Push'em all,Anshu Agarwal,5,,I like this game very nice game and join this game and any time I am bored and I have fun Princess game it's so good game and for your time pass üòäüòÑüòÑüòÑ I give it 5 stars üòçüòç
Push'em all,Damon Wilson,2,55,"WAAAAAAAAY to many ads!!! Ads pop up before the start of the level, in the middle of the level, and at the end of each level. I get the whole ""ads help us financially with the game"" thing, but good God! This is ridiculous!"
Push'em all,Clayton Howe,2,71,"The reasons I put 2 stars are. 1 the way you move makes the game hard. 2 its so easy to die because it makes you push instead of walking. 3 with my experience, as soon as 1 enemy pushes you, you got 100 trying to push you off."
Push'em all,Matthew Stolmeier,1,47,"Game has potential as far as a simple no brainer game. The controls are very sluggish though. When I lift my finger the avitar should stop moving. It doesn't. That makes controlling very difficult and,to be frank, unenjoyable."
Push'em all,Bella,4,5,"Great app. Highly recommend for younger kid, so under the age of 12. Pretty basic but entertaining."
Push'em all,Neal Gamertsfelder,2,3,"Very buggy, crashed every couple minutes. Not worth the download."
Push'em all,Hemant sati,3,,It lags when there are many enemies. Simple and easy game
Push'em all,Hoss Yordstorm,1,212,"It's a fun enough game, but is plagued by ads. These are part and parcel for free games these days, so I wouldn't mind. What I do mind are unskippable full ads just between rounds. If I opted for it to get something, sure. But the brief ones are enough."
Push'em all,GRANSPAD√Ñ 45,1,50,The game concept is a good idea but every level i play has over 4 ads that appear every 7-10seconds and it is the most annoying ad game I've ever played. Usually the ads are after each level. On this game it's while you are playing in the middle of the game.
Push'em all,Corey Arrington,3,7,Really fun game but a lot of adds and game will just cut out in the middle of a level. I also had to uninstall and reinstall because I could not get off a solid blue screen. Fix the technical problems and it's a great game.
Push'em all,Andrea Sierra,2,28,"The fact that they want to charge close to $6 for a game that literally has no new challenges after level 30 is hilarious. After level 30, it just keeps repeating, you get to know all the levels really well because there's nothing new ."
Push'em all,scott rittenhouse,1,30,The game is different and fun but way TOO MANY ADS destroyed any replay value!!! I dont mind an ad after a level but when you are moving around on the board and you get an ad in the middle of playing its repetitive and annoying. I deleted the game!!!!!
Push'em all,jmautobot,2,123,"Another game by this developer that's the same as the rest they make... full of ads. Cool Concepts but fall far short of what they could be because of way too many ads, no sound. They clearly have no interest in making a quality game that someone will want to play... and even pay for."
Push'em all,Nolan Croce,5,109,"I am so addicted. The different weapons make it really fun. The ads are extremely disruptive and ruin the experience. I paid for the no ads version but it was not really worth it. You still have to watch ads if you want to change your weapon. Overall, a very fun and addicting game."
Push'em all,chn cnls24,1,12,Its a great game overall. My main issue is the zones are just repeating no matter what the level is. Also it doesnt give you much cjoice what type of weapon you can have. Im at level 167 and ive gotten all weapons but it keeps reverting to the initial one.
Push'em all,Jeffery Fannin,4,29,"Very addicting. The only thing I hate about it is you can't choose your weapon. You have to spin for a weapon and more often than not, I get the one I don't want. Extremely frustrating. If they fix this problem, this may be one of my favorite time-wasting games."
Push'em all,Mahek Singhania,4,24,I could have given it 5 stars but the only reason why I give it only 4 is bcoz there are tooooooooooooooooo many ads. Even if the game is on it won't allow you to play but it has to 1st show you an ad. That's all. Rest the game is nice.
Push'em all,Jose Davila,1,36,"More ads than game play. Uninstalled about 5 minutes after I installed it. Ads in the middle of playing and not just once or twice, but incessantly! Cool, simple game with good graphics but the developer needs to rethink their revenue generating strategy."
Push'em all,Nick Nedrow,3,43,Game was great up until the most recent update. Now I can get through maybe 45 seconds of play when the game will lag and then force close on its own. I do not want to uninstall yet without knowing whether or not my paid version will be restored.
Push'em all,Halee Matherne,1,255,Way to many ad!!!! It's ridiculous!!! I can't even see if I would like the game because I'll I'm doing is watching ad after ad after ad. Played the game for five minutes and already watched 6 ads! Thumbs down for it all.
Push'em all,Peer Mann,5,11,Very addictive game to play. Warning if you do not have spare time then don't download this game. To be totally honest with you I love this game a lot. Downloading this game takes up your spare and time you may need doing other things thats importing.
Push'em all,BTH Ê≠¶ Shalin456,1,1,Most annoying game ever Theres an add after each level and I was working hard for one of those pushers(RPG) and when I finished an add came up and when it finished the spin was gone didnt gove it to me also overhead view makes it difficult to see where you are going especially since your character is tiny
Push'em all,Jolie x,1,29,"There are literally ads every 5 seconds. Awesome game, I would've kept it if it weren't for the ads in the middle of every level, after every level, and every time you die. Creators are obviously trying to make a quick buck. You ruined a great game ü§∑"
Push'em all,James Krieg,5,,"The game is fun and challenging. The only thing I would like to see changed is the ability to choose the tool we use when playing, rather than what the wheel spins up."
Push'em all,David Aguilar,1,31,"I'd like to tell you this was a fun, casual game. But with ads every 30-45 seconds...I didn't have a chance to play this long enough to get a decent review. I uninstalled this after 3 minutes. Clearing a zone just to watch a 39 second ad wasnt worth it"
Push'em all,William Seeber,3,,Cool game so far but cant get pass lvl 3 because game keeps crashing if u can fix the issue ill give it 5 stars
Push'em all,Michael Fitzgerald,1,24,Not even 10 seconds in and a 30 second forced ad is on my screen. At this rate thats 10 minutes of game play for every half hour of ads. More ads in the middle of levels and the ends of levels. If you like ads give it a try.
Push'em all,≈Ωaklƒ´na TeilƒÅne,2,2,I hate that I can't choose the pusher myself cause I really don't like many of them. Also that stupid spin is just spinning on it's own which is so annoying. And those ads... How am I supposed to enjoy the game if there are ads avery 5 seconds?????
Push'em all,Jonathon Palmer,1,12,"Too many Ad's. I understand that it is a free game, but there are enough Ad's and frequent enough to make me uninstall this game after 20 minutes of gameplay. I mean holy cow. An ad ever minute or two. Talk about frustrating."
Push'em all,Don't be,4,25,"Great game, really addictive, I've not once crashed while playing this game, the only downfall is the game is a little short and it would be fun to add more weapons to work towards"
Push'em all,Jonas Malmanche,1,123,To many stupid ads and does not give you the option of choosing your weapon. Same stages setout more less right through the whole sessions. Nothing new or exciting. The money u get is to buy a stupid person who does different moves when completing the game. How exciting that it.
Push'em all,Bonnie Matthews,2,53,"I don't mind the ads at the beginning, between each level and following each win or loss. I would love to choose the weapon to play each level with, but it's also fun to master each weapon. My problem is that the game has begun to crash frequently."
Push'em all,Gunna Pavani,1,9,How can i play the game there is tons of ads middle of the game why i'm giving 1 star you know because of the ads If they gave after the leve it's ok but you gave middle of the game. This is the reason i dont like this game ................................................................................ Worst.
Push'em all,Adam High,1,15,All of voodoo's games are garbage. The fake ads they put on Facebook to get you to download are always 100 times better than the actual game. Then you have to sit in the game and be forced to watch ads to progress levels. This is terrible don't waste your time with any voodoo game.
Push'em all,Michael Barrella,1,2,Fun bit crashed a lot. All those ads I saw I figured it would be a good game. Turn a out it's not. The developers have put more effort into commercials than the game itself
Push'em all,Christian Del Rosario,3,,"I really like game but there's a bug i hate: there are times that when using a weapon, instead of pushing enemies away they some rush towards you. Minor problem is the candy cane: sometimes the swipe just trips the enemies."
Push'em all,Aiden Collins,3,15,Good game lots of fun If your plan was to put so many adds in the game it will force people to pay for add free you are wrong its just going to make people loose interest. i got to level 23 and now im bored because i dont want an add appearing before DURING! And after each level
Push'em all,Jessie Bishop,1,13,WAY TOO MANY ADS! I understand no one likes ads and I understand this is a business that needs to make money and ads are how they do this. However when you spend as much time watching ads as playing there's a major issue.
Push'em all,Lalit Rawat,5,,This is very nice app for playing advice to all players download it and play lots of fun but why the spinner of this game spin himself check it
Push'em all,Darren Chow,3,1,Paid to have no ads but there are still ads...kinda feel ripped off.
Push'em all,mahesh chandra,1,17,It's true you have to make moneyüí∞ but it contains too many ads not only at the end of every level but even several times in the middle of it .it's more like a game in the ads than ads in the game. It could have been a great app if it had a bit less ads
Push'em all,Tiffany Minyard,1,14,"Ridiculous how many ads are in the game AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME!!! WTH?? Seems like a fun, kill time game but not dealing with all the freaking ads. DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless you like spending 2 mins watching ads to play a 45 second round."
Push'em all,John Cilino,5,16,What was the game sometimes it can get pretty easy sometimes it can get pretty hard if you don't like games like this particular game then I would not just playing it if you don't really want to be challenged but also do I guess I consider playing this game I think you would like it this game is awesome never want to play something that you can play Whenever this is the game for you
Push'em all,Galen Acevedo,1,16,"Game crashes randomly with no errors or warnings. Was a fun little time killer for about 6 minutes, but with 4 crashes within that time (and the ads) I spent less time actually playing the game than I did loading or waiting for ads. Uninstalling."
Push'em all,Kendra Brown,2,179,The game would be fun if it didn't crash every time I start to play it. Like I have been trying to play for about 30 minutes now and I've probably only spent 5 minutes playing out of the 30 mins because it crashes. I restart the game then boom crashes again.
Push'em all,Brb Moose,2,18,"Looked interesting, but with no instruction it is not clear how to do actions like the big push. The cannon is needed on one phase, but pushing wit it is not easy when it just keeps firing. Uninstalled"
Push'em all,Amaury Pena,4,15,"Great simple game! Easy to play and use, but a little disappointed that It doesn't have any sound affects?? Other than that it's fun to play as levels get harder with more weapon and character options. (Samsung A20)"
Push'em all,NASTY,4,14,I like this game but u cant always give a game 5 stars. I see a lot of reviews saying there getting alot of adds but i dont get any adds and im happy i dont get adds but theres more than 5 people saying they get a bunch of adds i agree with the person who said they shouldnt be paying to remove adds
Push'em all,Aaron Holland,2,11,"The game is actually fun, wish I could play it more. But the ads absolutely ruin the game. I understand any mobile game will have ads, but every 10 seconds you have to sit through an ad and it made me uninstall it"
Push'em all,dels channel gaming,1,17,"Really. Accepting data terms before we play, and the ads are ridiculous, died straight away from poor controls and it said continue watch a video or try again. Try again, and still watch a video. Bad!! Poor review!!"
Push'em all,Samantha Teh,5,23,"Pokggn Simulator is a great way of getting ready for the first place. simulator for a while ago, but I don't think I will be there by a year, but it will not be able too. piggy bank and then I don't know ready when it comes to a halt. no worries mate just the right"
Push'em all,Marcello Pelagalli,2,13,"The game could be fun, but the sheer amount of ads makes it impossible to play. It would already be excessive after each level, but this is mid level too it's just too much. Greed never pays guys..."
Push'em all,Caleb Konigsfeld,1,17,"Seems like it could be fun. As others have mentioned I got two ads in the middle of my level. It's one thing to have an ad after each level, which Is still excessive IMHO, but in the middle of gameplay makes it unplayable."
Push'em all,Zac Gates,2,4,Very easy game. You dont even have to push them they will walk off the edge on th their own. Simply walk out to the enemy then walk back to the start letting them follow you. They will then just walk of the edge. Can clear all but 3 this way.
Push'em all,Nancy Stirneman,5,19,"This game is so much fun. Yes it has ads, but I actually really like them because they give you a mini break before next wave and you can give your finger a break. Most ads are only like 5 seconds and you can skip!"
Push'em all,MD TORONGO,3,,Good game .i love it . There are many ads. Autherwise its a good but not to much good that I play .It is enough good for me.But please ubdate it.
Push'em all,Biig Silva,1,11,"Ok I'm tired now! This game could be so much better if we could choose our weapon, or at least not get it snatched by a roulette. BTW: the Candystick is weak and the wetpet and the hairdryer are not centered on the character. Please, just an update with weapon choosing and maybe new worlds?"
Push'em all,Wes Spicer,1,13,"Ads at the end of every level is annoying enough, but putting ads literally in the middle of each level? That's absurd. Without the massive amounts of ads, I'd probably give this a 4+ rating."
Push'em all,adrian turner,2,10,2 stars so you will actually look at it. It would be a fun game if it didn't force ads on you after every level oh and IN THE MIDDLE OF A LEVEL . Too too too many ads. Also the control scheme feels sluggish and not right.
Push'em all,ganesh cs,5,65,supper fantasy and wonderful game I liked it much better than other games I love this game playing because it has very high graphics and good quality of image and I suggested the game for my friends and family I am getting great response so I like this so much I think it pushem all 2 should come to play store ot would be very nice it would be crazy and specially it has a great controls it is best than other games I loved this game I wish god that part 2 of this game should come please please
Push'em all,Eevee Playz,1,31,"I gave it a try but the second I started to play IT SHOWED A AD and it was 20 secs and unskippable!! So I read some of these comments and now I get why it's called üòíüòí""Push em all""üòíüòícuz it just PUSH all the ads in your face!

Push'em all,Yes I Can,1,17,The game play isn't bad but It shows ads literally every 20-30 seconds and each ad's duration equal to 10-20 seconds. It's crazy. Don't install if you don't want to waist your time to watch ads.
Push'em all,Kathryn,1,12,"I would do no stars if it meant that I could still leave this review. The app only let's me play for a few seconds and it crashes and closes, everytime I reopen the app and start playing it closes again, not worth the time or frustration."
Push'em all,Timothy Jones,3,11,"Not too bad a game in reality, but could be better. The ads while there are a lot (a whole lot), for me seem to take place on the bridges between the areas, not in the actual area that needs to be cleared like one reviewer implied."
Push'em all,Nathan Anderson,1,10,Ads galore. Watch ads more than playing the game. I understand they want the money you'd have to pay for no ads but it's ridiculous the amount that there are. Despise games like this. Fun little game tho I suppose
Push'em all,Donald Chappell,3,4,I feel like when i lose and reset i dont go back to the start of that same map although i am stuck on that level. I also feel like the levels are being repeated over and over
Push'em all,kaustubh buran,5,,I like this game only one thing ads are many if the net is on
Push'em all,Matthew spider 100,5,1,It's very easy and also you get to push in a lot of zombies Everyone has to try it out
Push'em all,Trina Thom,1,22,"Did download....until....I saw all the negative reviews about the many ads while playing the game. Fix this issue, or you won't have many people playing. I've disabled the game. Thank you."
Push'em all,Caroline Whitaker,2,16,Way too many ads. I hate the ads during the levels. Yesterday I tried playing and after a few seconds the app just shuts down. I've tried multiple times and still isn't working properly.
Push'em all,Katie Stork,1,39,"Could be okay. If it didn't interrupt in the middle of a level to play a 5 second ad, as well as play more ads between every level. Would also glitch out and shut down every 3 levels, practically unplayable."
Push'em all,Chanchana Sornsoontorn,3,,Fun but no sound and the finger usually block the player
Push'em all,Elaine Kretovics,5,22,"Don't be fooled be the reviews whining about ads. They don't interrupt gameplay (they're only at checkpoints) and the developers need to make money somehow. If they bother you that much, set your device aside for the five seconds they make you wait to close them."
Push'em all,Pj Rolbert,1,11,"Tried to reload 3√ó to no avail, checked for updates none available. I guess you have to ""agree"" to relinquish your phone privacy(if u read that agree to) or the game shuts down at level 3. Sorry cannot recommend this one to anyone, especially my children!! R&R opinions."
Push'em all,Angelo H,5,7,"I got all the characters, I got all the moves, made it to level 1000. Got pretty monotonous. The preview looked like it got hard but never did. I still enjoyed my time. But I consider this game completed."
Push'em all,Kitara Grant,4,13,"OMG OMG I LOVE IT IM ABOUT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NO PUSH EM ALL 2!!! But.... Only 4 stars because, well, why do you have to spin a wheel to get a weapon?? Im not saying the weapons are BAD. But please make like a, place where you click to go online, or maybe fake players you can race with"
Push'em all,xx yy,1,13,I spend more time trying to get out of watching commercials than actually playing. I'll never download form you again. Get a new career if all you can do is an app where 60-70% of the time spent on it is being forced to watch commercials.
Push'em all,Mitch T.,1,5,"This game looked like fun, until I got interrupted at EVERY PHASE by an ad, it rendered the game unplayable, this is more like an ad program that lets you play a game between ads, than it is a game. No thanks."
Push'em all,Andrew Edwards,1,29,Great as long as I have no service. I'm not understanding why when I'm on wifi or data the app crashes constantly but if I'm not then I can play it for hours without a single crash. If we can resolve this I'll fix my rating to 5 stars
Push'em all,lephondo engeline,4,3,It is fun I enjoyed it but I got a little problem with the control
Push'em all,Bobby Luck,4,4,"Honestly, my only complaint is, that the controls are a little odd, i find my finger blocking my view from time to time. but i don't like giving 5 star reviews, what if you do improve?"
Push'em all,matthew mossman,1,17,Seemed like a decent game until not even 2 minutes into the game I had an add pop up and start playing in the middle of the level. I would understand it if it was in between levels but not in the middle.
Push'em all,The Fnaf Family,1,8,"If there where no ads I would have loved this game but these ads are ANNOYING please remove the ads I'm not even interested in those Games and remove ads from the continue button because I already had enough with the dumb ads üëø ""Great job"" creator with these ads REMOVE THE ADS"
Push'em all,maribel justiniane,4,,Fun game but i coudn't see my equipment men because of my finger to push/ move him
Push'em all,Addison R,3,6,"Not bad, but the random piece of choosing the weapon sucks. Some of them are just bad and not worth it. Ie the candy cane misses a handful of guys everytime so you have to be super diligent about making sure you get em all"
Push'em all,Reem Chaabo,1,10,If you are looking for an ads app download this game. if you want an app that offers you to continue when you fall by watching an ad and you say no thank you and still you get to watch an ad dowload this game. It's not even a game it's an ad bucket with a litlle bit of a game between every ad.
Push'em all,Gerry Angeles,5,11,Love this game..but it crashed on me two times..first one i was level 99..2nd time more or less level 300..i dont know why..and i have no way to bring back my levels if i uninstall and install it again like the first one..Please help..
Push'em all,dan m,1,10,"Literally unplayable because of the 30 seconds of ads every level, it takes less time to complete a level than an ad, just designed to force you to watch as many adverts as possible. Voodoo are the worst for trash games like this"
Push'em all,Jess Gregory,1,6,"Way too many ads!!! Mid-level, end of level, all the time! Gameplay is also not as smooth as the ad that is for the game would have you believe. Uninstalling."
Push'em all,Andre Aguieiras,1,7,"Fun at first, but then all the levels are the exact same. I have reached level 2093 and the layout has not changed the enemies have not changed I expected much more."
Push'em all,Mathew Cheshire,1,5,"Ads in the middle of a level completely kill the game. In between levels, fine. But during the middle of the level? Nah that's horrible design."
Push'em all,Louise Piper,2,5,It's a great game to pass the time. I find it distresses me too. The ads are the killer part of it as just keeps appearing and I even paid for this to remove ads
Push'em all,Craig Belchoff,5,17,"Once you pay a few bucks to get rid of the ads this game is awesome. Unlike most phone based games where you just make selections and then watch the outcome, this one you actually play it requires interaction."
Push'em all,Montray Gibson,2,6,This game was great until that stupid ass boomerang. When you go to spin and change no commercials to watch. As soon as you fall there's a damn commercial playing. If this is fixed I'll play again.
Push'em all,Deimoseus,1,13,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could, bad-decent time killer at best, and every 5 seconds you have to watch a 20 second Ad, this company just pushed this game out for easy ad revenue, dont even give them the satisfaction of installing it"
Push'em all,Ian Edmondson,2,2,"Another good idea ruined by untimely adverts. Could be good but far far far too many adverts game stops with no warning in the middle of levels, for adverts. Downloaded, now deleted."
Push'em all,Mhy Jethro,1,3,Very dissatisfied with the added feature. The 3 orange boxes below the screen eats your coins. Your pressing continue or retry but pressed one of the boxes. Very annoying üò°
Push'em all,omkar padave,1,,Pathetic controls .. it goes heyway. Hands starter paining in 10 mins useless... uninstalled it..
Push'em all,Leonn Ho,4,1,Game is good to de-stress. It's barely challenging but yet fun to while away time with when you don't want to be further challenged after a day of work.
Push'em all,Eric,1,6,"0/5 Would be at least 2 or even 3, but it's one of those pathetic apps that forces an add on you out of nowhere, right in the middle of gameplay. One of the fastest uninstalls of a game I've ever tried."
Push'em all,Sachin Thaokar,4,4,Good game I gave it four stars because as are coming in this game but it is a good game because of different kinds of zombies I will request the person who had made the game to do not keep the weapon spin I mean that we can take the weapon that we want to use thanks.
Push'em all,Laura Murray,5,6,"This is a ridiculously simple game that I've wasted entirely too much time on. Graphics are simple but respond well and ads are pretty minimal, even better if you're playing on airplane mode :)"
Push'em all,Ava Reaper,1,15,Too many adds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fail a level add complete a level add to use another weapon add and the worst one... when not choosing an add to continue also ... ADD!!
Push'em all,Nathan Harris,1,3,The weapons they give you get worse every time you get a new one. They give you a wind cannon. Then recycle it and call it a water cannon. Maneuverability is hardest with these 2.
Push'em all,Tarun Garg,1,1,Too many ads. Even covering half of the screen during the levels. Ads after each level is still fine.
Push'em all,Kubilay Kuce,5,,"Personal Experience: Cool game, no lag. Expected pets to attack and push an enemy every now and then tbh. Paid 10k for a pet to follow behind."
Push'em all,Devin James,1,10,"The permanent banner of ads causes a glitch where the bottom half of my screen works as the home button. When I dc from wifi it's fixed. Please do something about your ad-placement as us, thus game unplayable for me."
Push'em all,Riddhi Gupta,4,16,"It's a very nice game . I really liked it , the reason i didnt gave 5 stars is that when I try to drag it doesn't work sometimes otherwise its a good game for timepass.‚ò∫"
Push'em all,Charlene,1,3,"Have no idea if the game is fun or not, you don't get to finish a level before you get an ad, there's an ad after every level... literally every 10 seconds there's an ad."
Push'em all,Ambuj Chaudhary,1,2,Real sucker. Dont waste time for this game. Ads pop up during the game. Really sucking. No much variations are available in the levels. They are easier than expected.
Push'em all,STEVE SHAFER,1,5,Dont waste your time on this game way too many ads I understand the need for the ads but let the game run a couple of minutes before forcing people into watching an ad. Too bad could be a fun little game
Push'em all,Shaghayegh Armanfar,2,2,It includes too many advertisement and keeps exiting at the middle of the game. And also ads come at the middle of the game.
Push'em all,Darrell Preble,5,1,Awesome game to play when you are offline or on the move
Push'em all,maya ogbogu,4,9,"i like this game but the only thing i would reconsider is the ads. after you finish each section,(not level)it always shows an ad. everything else is great so keep it up!"
Push'em all,Griff,1,5,"Way too many ads, not even the short ones either. You'll spend more time forced to sit through long ads than actually playing the game, dont get this."
Harvest.io,Irina Petrescu,1,62,Lots of ads and you don't have the close button even if you didn't tap 'Revive' or stuff like that. They just pop up and then you can't close them. And it's just so stupid to not touch your own tail! What if it's too long? You die. What if someone surrounds you in a circle? You die. WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE SLITHER.IO?!
Harvest.io,ÿπÿ≤ÿßŸÖ ÿ∫ÿ®Ÿä,2,5,"This game is A better version of farmer.Io, but you will have to turn off your wifi, so you don't get bombarded with ads. The reason I gave it such a low score is because it get's boring quickly, the controls are bad, the game plays very slowly and it has very little depth."
Harvest.io,Dale-Jamie Todling,4,257,"App update on 6/6/20 results in the game no longer loading. It pauses on the leading screen and doesn't progress. Was hoping the update would have fixed the previous issue of getting to level 45, but level 46 not loading properly. Hope it's fixed soon."
Harvest.io,Beth Langer,3,20,"Steering isnt that great. I also dont see the point in being timed. I play another game like this that has no time limit. You just kill each other til you get 100% or just die. Lose the timer. Other than that, I do really enjoy this game"
Harvest.io,Samantha Moneymaker,3,34,I gave this 3 stars only bc once you reach a certain point in the game its like you can't advance any further. The amount of what you need to harvest disappears and you can't go any further. Please fix this so I can continue to play or unfortunately ill end up deleting bc I can't go any further.
Harvest.io,T. Richardet,2,15,Fun game to waste some time. Right up till lvl 25. No longer gives you the collections goals. Can't move to next lvl. Would have given more stars but that's a BIG bug.
Harvest.io,Kuku Rocky,2,169,"Very fun game I enjoy it a lot the only problem is you can only get to level 22 and then after that there is one resource to collect to get to level 23 that is not in the game. Whats funny is right after I had payed to remove the ads, thats when the a resource became unavailable. I was able to collect some of the resource because of a ad to watch to help give you some of that resource but not enough to reach the 23rd level."
Harvest.io,Zachary Sanchez,5,287,Sooooo fun I really like it and I'm not payed to say this. If you are playing and you think why is there so manny adds then just turn of WiFi and your mobile data. It will take away all ads. This is such a good game so just try it. I recommend a really good game called(agario.io) it's really fun. Try both game then put a review on both.VERY GOOD GAME!!!!
Harvest.io,Vontrase Dunbar,5,55,I like it for what it is. The ads are ok. My only issue is that it needs to be optimised and the steering is off. Sometimes it dosent even respond. And there is a company out on the playstore withbthis exact game. With better steering. So please fix these issues as i love casual azur games and the developers are great with great games.
Harvest.io,Linda Clark,3,5,"I love the game itself but I do not like the controls, you can easily lose control and turn the wrong way and run into yourself. And i don't like that you die from running into yourself either. Change those 2 things and i will rate 5 stars"
Harvest.io,Ashley Scott,2,4,I was loving the game. Enough to pay for the no ads which I absolutely never do and it stops completely at level 25 with no warning or explanation as to why. Soo awful.
Harvest.io,schquenta rush,5,3,I love this game because of the colors and how it's made cuz I always win and btw it's a good game so you should play it
Harvest.io,Darlok Williams,1,159,"As much as I hate VOODOO games, they at least steal GOOD versions of these .io games. Harvest.io is horrendous. Very poor controls, lackluster graphics, and frustrating gameplay. I'd understand if you were a new developer and this were just a beginners attempt, but you claim to be an actual company. In that case, you should be ashamed of actually releasing this broken mess."
Harvest.io,Lisa Thomas,3,,"I was loving game , but for this last day its done nothing but crash every time I have collected , keep having to restart game , nearly ready to delete, shame as good app"
Harvest.io,mona gibson,2,3,Fun but ADS WAY TO MANY ADS. Also freezes. I would love to play but bugs and Ads stop me. I realize ads make it free but I watch more than I play. No one needs this many ads. Fix the bugs plz.
Harvest.io,Evalena Hoover,2,180,"DON'T PLAY THIS GAME WITH YOUR CHILD OR LET YOUR KID PLAY!!!! I LIKE the game... but hate the ads. I know you need to pay for your game. I don't actually care about ads especially if you get double your rewards by watching them.. HOWEVER.... . 1. If I am on a game rated for ""E"" everyone why am I seeing PORNOGRAPHIC ads? 2. Whether I press collect or collect x2 with Ads I WATCH AN AD!! (and once again a PORNOGRAPHIC AD marked ""OVER 18"")"
Harvest.io,Alex E,1,101,"ADS! I understand giving the option to watch an ad to get double the rewards, but if I choose not to go for the double reward, it's completely unacceptable to still give me a 30 second unskippable video ad."
Harvest.io,Larissa Fanning,1,3,Was doing fine and now it is not keeping track of how many crops are being harvested so you cant move on. Requested a refund since we cant play anymore. No one has ever responded to my request!
Harvest.io,Moon Watcher,1,114,"I played this game for only 5 minutes and i hate it already! This is a waste of time! The controls are terrible, you die randomly, and there are way to many ads! Complete waste of time do dont install! üò§üò°"
Harvest.io,Franz Unhold,3,6,"Like the game, but when sound was added, a glitch in collecting harvest and recording it stopped at level 25. Hopefully this can be resolved."
Harvest.io,Melissa Butler,3,,"I live the game but when I get to about level 12, I can no longer track my progress. That's disappointing."
Harvest.io,Josh Hanson,1,1,"It's a fake .io game! It's not actually multiplayer - set your phone to airplane mode and it keeps working. The other ""players"" are actually bots."
Harvest.io,Christina Belanger,3,198,AMAZING game but i gave it 3 stars bc of the controls. They aren't the best. I will be going straight and all the sudden i will be gone left or right. Its really annoying! Plz fix!
Harvest.io,Erin Wittkowski,4,4,Fun game but past a certain level you can no longer see your crop collection goals. Not sure what I need to advance or if I ever will.
Harvest.io,Nat Lee,5,24,"Love it. Not sure why coz its a little tractor harvesting, but im addicted. Love the little details of the vegetables too! Wish option to be last one standing and not jst 2mins"
Harvest.io,Susan bush,4,35,Suddenly I can't get any money or move up. Perhaps I gave reached a limit for the free game. Fun while it lasted.
Harvest.io,Barron Taylor,3,26,I love the game but i hate how when you hit the wall it automatically turns so if you can fix that. That would great
Harvest.io,Saroj Tiwary,5,15,"This game is very interesting!! When i was playing this game, i just feel like i am a farmer .... Ploughing the ground."

Harvest.io,Elle Naomi,2,62,This game is okay but a little confusing. This app can be very slow but it is a little fun. I give this two stars.
Harvest.io,Alexander Campbell,1,7,It let's you collect until you get to level 21. Then it stops you collecting to go to next level.Major bug sine it's update. Not worth the download.
Harvest.io,Susana Gonzalez,3,5,I like the game and the idea behind it but after level 22 it doesn't progress to another one.. I wish it did have more levels and more upgrades..
Harvest.io,seyanka misquitta,1,3,The game gets hanged and cannot click on collect button because of the ad and have to re start the game
Harvest.io,andy dodds,1,13,"Nice game, but uninstalled because of too many ads that play when I choose 'no ad' option to collect"
Harvest.io,Ella Celeste,5,8,"This game was a skip ad and when I saw it, it was just so satisfying and I downloaded it it's my new favorite game I love it üòÅüôÇ"

Harvest.io,Singhjagmeetbola Bola,1,,This game is hanging alot when i am collecting the crops its get hanged.....
Harvest.io,Bryan Denton,1,7,If you like to watch an ad after every time you die then this is the game for you.
Harvest.io,Dave ConingJr,1,,You've had your chance to clean up the x-rated commercials and the pornographic material in such commercials in a game for Everyone. Now you are deleted and will never download another azur game. This nasty material does not belong in the face of childern. Had to rate the game to post the comment sad thing is game is probably worth more than one star but if your careless enough to show these commercials to children then you deserve nothing at all. SICK AND SADISTIC. Get your act together!

Harvest.io,Marcus Seals,5,301,"**five stars so I can be in top** If you turn your wifi and mobile data off you can play the game without ads. What about the other players? There were never other players to play against, it only sets ai to play the game with you. This is evident in the play style and never changing names. 10% smarter people, you only need to be 10% smarter than the equipment you use."

Harvest.io,ManicMan 2298,2,85,"A copy of Farmer.io , the graphics aren't as good, the steering of the tractor is horrible. It's like trying to turn a car with power steering that's out of fluid and the belts slipping. Not holding my hand on my a$$ hoping they fix this game."

Harvest.io,Hamran Marman,2,2,"Kinda like Snake‚Ñ¢, except you're riding a tractor. Your snake/tractor grows as you harvest the field, or when you steal other snake/tractor's harvest. I spent only 10-15 mins in the game, ads are acceptable (only for resurrection or 2x the harvest, didn't see any other VIDEO ad), but the lag is unbearable. It's like the game is running at 5 frame/sec, or less. Not sure what happened to my harvest too, or leveling up. I think I maxed my level once, but didn't see any change. Not my genre, sorry."

Harvest.io,David Bott,2,24,Controls are funky and sometimes you die because they seem to randomly flip. Also I am on level 21 and they are telling me to harvest a plant that doesn't exist in the game. Maybe it's a bug they know about but I emailed the developer and have heard nothing so not impressed with that. Fun goofy game but overall unimpressed with the response and bugs. I even paid for ad free.

Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Dj Andri,5,5,Thip game is super fun and also when I win and when I lose several times. This game is very fun with all the maps I can play and 1 review said the desert Sucks. Please answer the one I said to you. Thanks for the game. And I love the game and I have another game that can suck up things and the game name is hole io. Well that all the imformation I can get from this game and I will change my review in the future.üòÄüòÅüòäüòç
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Arturo Cofresi,1,6,"What can I say. Sometimes your ship wont go where you point it at, AI pushes things out of the map before anyone really eats anything. Not very fun. 1 minute of gameplay 30-45 seconds of ads... That open googleplay on their own before you can close them! No thanks."
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,harshath,1,31,"Do you want your game to be played or not? Why do you give unskippable ads after 10-20 games üòíüòí Game is good but due to ads i will never play it again Please don't waste your time people!

Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Coach,3,31,"I like the idea, but the graphics are remedial and the controls are slow and it feels as if you're pulling or pushing your UFO. With some minor improvements, this could be a really addictive game."
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,clinton skutt,1,24,The characters need to be able to move faster they are slower than molasses and you can't do anything in the time it gives you we need to be able to move fast game is fun but I hate how slow we have to move. !!!!!!!

Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,pavani medisetty,1,42,So i downladed it and started playing i thought it was like hole.io. then when i was the smallest i fastest and niggest the slowest that a big flaw the ads are a problem aswell.The UFO got really big that i could not see the screen.Overall i do not recommend this game
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Mike Woods,5,3,Im hooked.....i play til the battery saver nearly shuts my phone OFF.
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,beefwellingtonism,2,140,"1. Is this game called Spacebump.io, Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars? 2. The controls suck especially when you pick a speed boost. Y'all need to fix that. 3. Too many ads & before you say the game is free, Im not paying for ad free. If I watch two ads in a row, I shouldnt be forced to watch any more for at least 3-5 matches. Fix those issues snd I'll give a higher rating."
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Peter Archibald,4,,Enjoyment + very few ads!
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Amy Dee,1,59,"This games stinks. Thought it was gonna be like ""Hole"" and such but not even close. First off why is it when I start out instead of the ""too large to pick up"" items just not fitting within the ring, my ship flies low so I bang into buildings?? Design Flaw. Secondly why is it the more you gather the slower you get? Ridiculous Design Flaw ... Again. I'm deleting. Too many good games out there to be wasting space on foolish games. Fix the flaws."
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Awnna Aldinger,4,1,Once you grow you go really really slow and that's one problem for me
Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Endrea Mcloughlin,4,28,I love the game it's super fun. I don't like that there is a timer but can't argue with that. but I gave a 4 star rateing because of the control. it's super hard to control the UFO. but good game though

Crazy Spaceship.io: Alien Wars,Frank Morgan,4,2,"The downside is bot A.I. It will gang up on you 15 to 1. So no actual pvp, just names. Im maxxed out, and nothing to really use gems on except boosters that are nullified by teamed up bots."

Big Big Baller,Zoey Cone,4,39,"Don't get me wrong, this game is actually awesome. But, there are a couple things that are not. There are so many ads, it's honestly annoying. And, this took 10 minutes to be download. Maybe make it where we can open chests for free sometimes? Besides that, the game is totally awesome."
Big Big Baller,Relicym R,3,6,"Gameplay is good, but it gets very laggy the bigger you get. Why are the objects sticking to the ball? I thought we are supposed to crush them. Too many ads, best played offline."
Big Big Baller,Kai Kristoff,3,6,A fun game. I got tired of hearing the same ad after every round.
Big Big Baller,Imogen Whaley,4,15,"I love this game, but I suggest adding a feature so that you can play with your friends."
Big Big Baller,Thura Min Swe,4,6,this game is ok but can you guys tell me the ads are soo annoying you are asking to see ads to get something ok i know but can you make some free make tthe chest that we take soo plese do that but the other they're ok
Big Big Baller,iLoveLobster,2,11,Latest bug fixes made the game unplayable (sluggish) after 1 game. Have to restart.
Big Big Baller,the galaxy channel,5,3,Its so much fun but i wish there were more mamps like a hounted map or a villige map but overall this is the perfect game for me
Big Big Baller,Seamus Lennon,3,4,I've had this game since 2019 but since then every time I play a round it stops
Big Big Baller,moon monkey 518,2,495,"Now, I can say that I enjoyed this game (for a while), and I think the idea as a whole is a good one. However, after hearing about a lot of .io games actually being all bots, I started to wonder if this game was the same. Even though its advertised as an online game (while not specifically stating it is), it's not, which means I don't feel prideful anymore when I win a match like I used to. If your wondering which games have real players, turn you wifi off while playing and see what happens."
Big Big Baller,jdoexrayvision,5,389,Graphics be damned! The gameplay is excellent. There are a few of these Katamari clones out there and this is the best one. The programmers did a great job on the AI. It fooled me into thinking I was playing against real players for a long time because it consistently demands my best in order to win. Now I'm up to higher levels and I can't make any mistakes or it's 5th or worse.
Big Big Baller,Ryan Hermecz,5,,Awesome game me and both of my son's have it downloaded and absolutely love it.
Big Big Baller,sdereis,2,169,"The game SEEMS like you are playing with people around the world, but there is no difference of play on/off line, I put the phone to sleep and it continues from where I left off. I place it on airplane mode, and it shows as if I'm playing with other. Stop trying to fool people."
Big Big Baller,Kennedy Lee,5,60,It's really amazing and I really like this so that's why I gave you a 5-star and it's amazing so I feel like kids out of 2 other numbers of Ages and style you can pick your own style of which ball you want and I think that is amazing and I just love this game.
Big Big Baller,Maria :D,2,44,"the flag for the Philippines should be fixed right away. it's quite ""offensive"" that the red part is on top (meaning the country is at war, which is totally wrong), the blue part SHOULD BE on top (meaning the country is at peace / war-free)."
Big Big Baller,Leah Gray,3,34,"Meh, it's ok I guess. Kept me entertained for a couple of minutes. But then it started lagging after a while whenever I got really big. And my charactars skin once glitched out. Please fix."
Big Big Baller,Trinity Antal,1,12,"So fake. It's super annoying when all the all other balls are chasing you, but never get each other. I always lose 2 seconds into the game."
Big Big Baller,Moto Phone,1,3,"Poor controls, hard to use, not really fun. Can't change my name, can't make out graphics unless I hold perfectly still. Play Hole-io instead. Similar premise, much better done."
Big Big Baller,francis backmask,4,2,Addictive and challenging one of the best game on play store BUT too much ads.. its killing the fun .. I wanna play longer but the ads reminds me not play long
Big Big Baller,ice cold,5,102,Very relaxing. Somewhat hard to control the ball sometimes.
Big Big Baller,Cy Bishop,2,20,"I love this game, but now the screen is covered with buttons and stuff when I try to play so I can't really see what's going on. Blech."
Big Big Baller,Kara Norman,3,9,there are so many types of balls it's so hard to find the ball you want but it is so fun
Big Big Baller,Jamal Jailani,3,1,I can not keep control of my ball properly
Big Big Baller,Anne Luzier,4,,Game needs more map options.
Big Big Baller,Ali Shaban,5,12,It is really fun but I think you should add a solo mode
Big Big Baller,Radhakrishna J,4,19,It's good.....but improve the graphics and add some super powers to the game it will be awesome then......thanks bye be
Big Big Baller,matt bernard Casagnap,5,11,I love this game it's a bit laggy but it's ok I still like the skins I actually beat the challenge too

Big Big Baller,JdMisterClean 2008,2,,Bad. Runs bad. It runs bad. So easy
Big Big Baller,Curtis Vaughn Jr.,1,8,It is a add every time you die and everytime you spawn in Battle Royale there is someone bigger than you
Big Big Baller,Siha Rakhet,5,5,Very fun game to play and a good time waster.
Big Big Baller,Nana Nana,4,,I love this game but sometimes gets stuck
Big Big Baller,Max Brezden,5,12,The game is very fun there is so much to explore
Big Big Baller,Janet Chalmers,5,4,This game is very very easy to play.This will be fun. I can win so easily.
Big Big Baller,Byran Condon,5,80,I have never seen an ad yet and this game is fun.
Big Big Baller,Little Fireboy,5,43,I really like it because when you squash the opponent's it's so satisfying
Big Big Baller,Jeffrey Templado,5,3,"Roll over and crush everything to become bigger and bigger! ""Where Am I? In a city?! Oh hi~ you little cute car! Oops, I'm sorry!"" The ball crushed a car accidentally, however, the ball seems to get bigger! That's interesting, let's see how big it can get and crash everything in your sight! You can also crash other player's ball which is smaller than yours! Now, time to roll over the amazing city! Features: * Free to play, play it anywhere anytime * Simple rules but very attractive * Lots"
Big Big Baller,Ricardo Koekemoer,3,4,It's a good game bat Sam time it's not working and it's pras is hay bat it's stil √† good game üòÉüòÑüòÄü§©üòâüôÉüôÇ
Big Big Baller,Jerry Spradling,5,12,"Good clean fun, great game to kill time!"
Big Big Baller,Ccs Ccs,5,1,This game is so much fun and easy.
Big Big Baller,Carson Ng,4,,"This is a very good game about this. But if u tap your ball will run so fast , I cannot see any things. I think this game can move abit a bit."
Big Big Baller,nancy uy,4,10,Good but the flag of the philippines is wrong:) the flag is STATE OF WAR flag.
Big Big Baller,rhianna maxwell,3,,I like the game i just dont think it should have a timer pls change that ut eould be a better game
Big Big Baller,Vidya B,3,2,"It was fine..but I keep losing because, If I buy the double size initial, it doesn't have an effect on the game! It's probably a glitch or a problem with my device. But I did waste coins.."
Big Big Baller,Agata wi≈õniewska,5,1,Player keep killing me and I keep ending up last place
Big Big Baller,Tala playz Roblox,3,,"This game is fun like sooooo fun but it is the same difficulty in each match I mean it is really easy and kinde if boring , I really wish that there are levels and mini challenges or stuff , like more stuff ."
Big Big Baller,Cora Hiraban,5,12,"It's so good this is very addicting because you can stick surroundings like a magnet ball and upgrades your size into a giant ball and make you believe that others say ""This is addicting!!!!"" And i believe what your saying. It's so good to tilt your balls starting from small to gigantic things and you're crushing other ball players in your way."
Big Big Baller,Mora Just,2,4,Why is it that you lose when you get second or third not just first in tortament that is wrong
Big Big Baller,jacob maynard,1,13,"P2W trash, pay 200 coins to double your ball's size before each game"
Big Big Baller,steve Timmins,5,8,It keeps me entertained when I'm bored I would really recommend this game
Big Big Baller,qinx_1 x,4,,"Its a great game but sometimes it gets boring, It would be nice to have more place options"
Big Big Baller,Angel Jarred,4,15,"This game is very addicting! The only no no about it is the ads. Over all I love it! They have the country balls ( not only australia, America, Mexico, Spain, UK, but alot of other countries like the Philippines, Korea,Thailand,Bali,Switzerland. You get free skins!All you simply have to do is wait a few hours then you get a new skin! The map is HUGE! I really recommend this game!"
Big Big Baller,Josh Gresham,3,58,"Love the game, hate the way the ads are set up. I'm willing to watch ads for free for any and everything, but I almost always am told there are no ads available and to try again in a few seconds. Well, that just keeps happening, so I give up on watching ads. This is the only game I've ever played with that problem, so I don't know what's causing it but y'all need to work on it. It's extra annoying too that the ads have no problem loading after each and every match, but they can't load when I want to double my xp or get a wheel spin or unlock a chest."
Big Big Baller,Nate S,3,8,"I'm not usually one to complain, but I feel the need to say something here. I'm giving this 3 stars, not because of the ads or the actual gameplay (which is great by the way. I really do love playing), but because of the addition of paying to increase your size. It just feels like this is EA all over again. I dont see why they couldnt keep all players on an even playing field. At least put out a playlist or map where using an increased size is disabled. Then players could at least have the option."
Big Big Baller,Layla Gamer,5,200,"This was an amazing game!! Extremely addictive and super fun to play. I'm so good, I get #1 every time almost! Graphics are great, objective is fun, all great things to say about this game. Only thing wrong with it is that the controls are hard for my hands, because they are kinda small : 3 other than that the game is FABULOUS 10/10"
Big Big Baller,Joshua Martin,3,1,"I don't usually comment about the ads in a game, but I have to say. They are everywhere. They often don't work right, and you lose rewards even.after watching them. I dontnunderstand why you would bother to collect a chest just to watch an ad later. You can watch the ad later already and still get a roulette at coins. Pointless annoyance!!!"
Big Big Baller,Natalie,1,2,"This game is fun, but they make it seem like you're playing other people but you're just playing yourself and just win every time unless you literally sit and don't move the entire game. Even starting to play the last thirty seconds, somehow you catch up and everyone just stops growing. Wish there were online mode (maybe there is with battle royale mode, but it won't work on my phone)."
Big Big Baller,Andrew Dehlinger,1,40,The game spawns you in next to your opponents some of whom have paid to be bigger than the rest that instantly pulverize you. Also at the end of the round you can either spin for a prize at the cost of an ad. Or you can go back to the menu at the price of another ad. Oh and if you wanna find another game guess what another ad. Its fun for about 10 minutes then it becomes tedious.
Big Big Baller,Ryan Keough,3,149,Probably the most fun Katamari style mobile game I've played but it's pretty shallow. It took me less than a half an hour to unlock every map and learn a route on that map to guarantee I win every time. A good time killer for the subway but easy to get tired of.
Big Big Baller,Ryan Aubin,1,,"First off, unless you connect with Bluetooth...you play bots. You don't need a data connection to play Classic mode which shows me the ""player base"" is actually just random generated bots. I even started a game on wifi and cut it off half way through and was about to complete the game with the opponents still playing. Donnelly false advertisement. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is fun I guess...just way less fun now that I realize I'm not playing against anyone."
Big Big Baller,A Google user,1,20,"This game is just bad! I would not recommend downloading it at all!!! First off, many small objects are linked together that shouldn't be. You can push through ANYTHING at any size level. But the really annoying thing is that once you get big enough to roll up buildings, ie where the game should be fun, the game lags terribly that you start moving at a snail's pace!!! And I'm not on old phone either! Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one."
Big Big Baller,Da'Sean Kelley,3,3,"It's ok but if it actually had an online multiplayer mode it'd be a little better otherwise that's the only downside I have, promotes multiple players but really it just does what Mario Kart tour had everyone thinking the first few day that it had online multiplayer when it most definitely didnt"
Big Big Baller,MrAvoidlogin,2,3,"i play this kind of game on a pc b4 and its the same method as on android. This one is terribly laggy, not good in direct response, not enuff setting .This game doesnt have good response and yet developers put extra ads for extra cash.Most likely to kill ur customer fast."
Big Big Baller,Vidushi Bhargava,4,1,It is amazing . I recommend that all kids should install this app üëçüòâ
Big Big Baller,Jason T,2,144,"Game just became unplayable without paying. You now have an option to double your starting size for in game coins (purchasable for real money). Considering everyone starts nearly touching already, you get destroyed immediately without this boost. Even if you do escape, for some reason you move faster the bigger you are so you can't run away even if you wanted to. Poor game design"
Big Big Baller,Alan Messenger,1,1,"Good game has potential, however, the ads are a big problem. I'm happy to sit through a short video to support the devs but when I click on the watch ad to double xp or get free coins or bonus spin and it tells me no ads available but then has the cheek to spring an ad on me just for clicking play again then i think the devs need to go back to the drawing board, ain't nobody got time for that!"
Big Big Baller,JennieFilms,1,95,This isnt even fair they shouldn't allow the people that pay 200 coins to get bigger to be with the smaller ones. I think they should have separate games based on if they payed the 200 or not. And the controls are irritating it's kinda hard to get away when about to die please fix this I love this game but hate all this stuff it needs to be fixed.
Big Big Baller,Ernie Roman,5,2,"Good times, fun way to kill time.."
Big Big Baller,Talen Cox,1,1,"super laggy, bad interaction, it's super sensitive to the opposite side of the screen your touching... by that I mean I'll touch the right side of my screen and it'll go left, the short timer sucks because you barely get any time to play, if there is a different game mode them many give a tutorial so people actually KNOW?!? that lagging SUCKS I can barely play at all, and when your small and you try to get things your size, you just miss around somehow! I have deleted the game until it's better."
Big Big Baller,A Nas,4,9,This game scratches the Katamari itch in a way the official Katamari game does not. I really wish the developers would add more maps and challenges. The new feature that allows other players to start with a larger ball feels like cheating and a reward for mediocrity. I feel like there should be a minor penalty for this like a 2 second delayed start.
Big Big Baller,A Google user,2,,this used to be a great game but now i hate it! first when you are small you just zoom around the map and its ao hard to get bigger before it was easy! i was even on the leader bourd or it was a dream but i think i was but still make more items for small people and make it easier to control!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Big Big Baller,J T,1,109,Used to be good. Loved the battle royale. Now computer kills you in literally 1 second because they are bigger and you can watch an ad to continue. Then if you choose not to there is an ad waiting for you. Even if you make it through the game they went from a few minutes to under one. I understand ads make the money for a free game and I don't mind watching a few but not every 30 seconds of play. It's no longer fun for me.
Big Big Baller,Ed Locatelli,3,45,"Idea of the game is cool, and keeps you playing, however, if you play long enough you can see several super annoying issue. One of them being that not everyone travels the same speed. Extreamly unfair, especially when the A.I. has an enemy follow/chase you as if they are tethered to you. That a few other issues, drop the stars a bit."
Big Big Baller,Jon Castillo,2,3,"Would be a decent game, save for the egregious amount of Ads you get for simply trying to do anything. Opening a chest after winning a match? Ad. Tapping the play again button? Ads, ads, ads. There's also the fact that you can even choose to start with a bigger ball size, even in the Battle Royale mode which baffles me, and the amount of coins you earn per match is so painfully low for the price of a cool looking ball. Don't waste your time."
Big Big Baller,Yoshi United,3,3,It's great but... lots of ads if you want me to give a 5 star don't use sooooooooo much ads
Big Big Baller,Rizwan Raja,1,27,"My previous review was balanced and although I disliked the latest change in making some enemy balls bigger at the start, I wasn't as harsh about it as others have been. Well in actual fact the game is now utter utter garbage. Sure the game is still fun if you can actually get away at the start. Does it happen often? No of course not, 9 times out of 10 you will now get crushed within the first few seconds. Absolutely ridiculous and a joke. Winning the game now is such a rarity."
Big Big Baller,messyjessi6791,4,11,It would be nice to watch the ads to open chests and get spins but it keeps saying there aren't any ads available but then immediately plays an ad when I get tired of clicking the watch ad button and getting the no ad message. It's caused me to lose a lot of chests and I can't see a reason why ads won't play when it goes straight to playing an ad after saying it can't. Please fix this issue. Otherwise the game is great!!
Big Big Baller,Eric Ongerth,2,73,"Incredibly low frame rate even on a fairly high-end phone, even while the graphics of the game are pitifully low-res and extremely simplified polygons with very plain textures. It's hard to believe this is considered a shipping quality app. Also, I've won every round I've tried from the very beginning, which fits with what everyone else is saying, that the other 'players' in each match are not human controlled. There's no way I should win so easily every time."
Big Big Baller,Lydia Baker,1,,Hate the game it's hard to control the ball and there is so many add.
Big Big Baller,Kierali B,2,2,"Ads are ridiculous, if you click one for a chest or to spin a wheel it says there aren't any ads available, then when you try to go back to the home screen it assaults you with an ad. At least let me pick when I watch ads and give me something in return! Also needs to have more perks for gaining levels, like bigger starting size but not using coins? Something!?"
Big Big Baller,Ellen Wootten,1,,Fine game. Game mechanics are fine but if you don't let them have your consent for data to send to ads you have to go though every time and confirm that decision. I don't appreciate that or the passive aggressive text that displays when you don't have the options you want. Unbearable and uninstalling.
Big Big Baller,Daniel Walsh,3,34,"Decent game but the ads completely ruin the overall experience. While I understand ads are necessary for a free app, the way they're implemented in this game is very poorly done. They appear during the game itself as banner ads, appear after EVERY game as a full-screen video, appear anytime you want to open a chest as a full-screen 30 second video .. it's too much and too intrusive. I would pay for ad removal except they only offer it in a ""bundle"" package which they want $6.50 CAD for."
Big Big Baller,Steve ThatOneGuy,1,57,"Entertaining, but the reason I'm rating it a 1 is because in battle royale mode, some players literally start bigger than anyone else (without having to pick up anything), and then go straight for you, killing you instantly. Why do some people get an instant advantage?"
Big Big Baller,Kris Kohler,2,407,"Another ad crazy game where they annoy you wherever they can with more and more ads. On top of that the fact that it starts lagging once you get big enough to pick up cars is quite annoying. Also, don't say ""matchmaking"" if we're just playing with bots. Just say Loading at that point. Very clunky over all. 2/5. Cannot recommend."
Big Big Baller,I America,1,453,"i like the game. i have the highest hi speed wifi with cox and im the only one on it. i have a great phone. this app glitches the bigger your ball gets however, the Ads come in perfect. the developers are being greedy. they need to lessen the load so players can play glitch free. otherwise whats the point. its like watching stop motion. one star. only because i cant give zero."
Big Big Baller,8BP NoGuideLine Hero,4,95,"TOO THE DEVELOPERS! I would give five stars but these are my problems with the game as it stands and what I would like too see put in the game. 1.) Another gamemode too play offline too have a certain amount of time too eat the whole map. 2.) For each kill you get in classic or battle royale mode you get an additional amount of xp or coins per kill. 3.) Id also like too see in the offline version where you would try too eat the whole map in a certain amount of time too be a few different landscapes you could choose from and too make the multiplayer landscapes change like once a week or once a month. 4.) I also think there should be an option too buy double xp for 1 week 1 month or a lifetime since you guys have the weekly competition for xp. These are just some of the ways i think you could improve your game and make more profit. I hope too see some of my ideas in the game too a point, Thanks Overdose!"
Big Big Baller,Matt Fox,2,166,"Too many ads to be enjoyable. You're basically forced to watch an ad at every opportunity. On the title screen, here's an ad. Play a match, watch an ad. Want to open a chest, watch an ad."
Big Big Baller,Fred Dains,5,12,"I believe that this game is a record breaking app on a personal level, as it's been on my phone for the longest period of time. Kind of reminds me of a game I used to play on my Xbox 360, just a bit simplified and more straightforward, but that is in no way a bad thing. I like the two game modes and I can't wait to see what further updates will bring. I only have one issue with the app, and that is when I'm up into the extremely large stage, the graphics can get a bit wonky. This is probably not even a problem with the app as much as an issue of my phone's underwhelming performance. But hey, what do I really expect if I'm unwilling to part with more than $200-$250 when it comes to phones? This is why I still gave the app five stars."
Big Big Baller,Shawna Walsh,1,175,"When you decide to not watch their ads after getting a chest, your gold is removed despite getting +200. Mine was 300 before my +200, and after it was 180. Tell me that makes sense. Also just a mundane and boring game. Very redundant and not challenging. I won my very first round and almost every one after. It dropped my gold balance significantly twice. Between each round you must endure long (30s+) ads, each followed by demo games. Gimmicky, glitchy, not worth it. Deleted."
Big Big Baller,Siann Gabrielle Ponciano,5,4,Its not even hard at all and i like to cosetumose my ball and you can collect chest and gets something good on the will gets some coins gets some skins and more
Big Big Baller,mark muller,2,33,Well first of all the game play is easy. But other players on there are fake. So if you think your playing against people u are not. They are bots. I can take a call on my phone for 3 mins and resume the same spot with the same score with a 1:50 second count down. So no multiplayer
Big Big Baller,{Smol Gacha Gurl},5,18,"I really love this game because it is very fun and addicting. One time at my grandmother's house I played this for 2 hours and I just love it! This game can get very funny because you can sing ""I came in like a wrecking ball!"" And get a huge building onto your ball. I love running over other balls and collecting what they worked hard to get it just gets you 1st place! I thing you should make a part 2. Thanks for the attention, And call me Kat."
Big Big Baller,Vincentthee epic,5,3,This game is the best the gameplay is excellent and I never seen an ad it's so fun I wish new update more fixes üòÑ
Big Big Baller,Scott Pena,5,1,Fun game that the whole family likes to play.
Big Big Baller,A Google user,3,6,"The overall concept of the game is fun, but for players over the age of 12 you will realize the skill it takes to play is minimal. The game lacks difficulty and rather than playing against other humans, it seems as though everyone else is AI. I have won all but one round I've played. It is definitely a good game for blowing time, but not one I would spend more than 15 minutes on."
Big Big Baller,hanna alulod,2,1,This game was....WAS good before i updated today. It is soooo laggy. I could deal with the fact that it eats battery life but with lags aswell?? Music/soundtrack was better before i get that excitement while i see the count down before u start rolling but now naaahhh. And what is that advantage to be bigger ball from the start to kill right away? Whole point is get bigger first then kill smaller ones!?
Big Big Baller,A Google user,5,105,The best game ever made!!!üòçüòçüòçü§©ü§©ü§©it is simple yet detailed.I enjoyed the gameplay so freaking much that I can't stop playing!I like all the different types of skins and all the bright colors in the game.Also pls..just pls make a team game mode .I hope that this improves. Just think on adding challenges and maybe some new skins?!? Bruh I can't believe it's only rated a 4.2 stars. I think it would be rated a 4.8 stars. Maybe I over exaggerated but it should probably be higher rated than that.(just saying)
Big Big Baller,J1103 Josh,4,49,"Gameplay itself is good. Fairly easy to control. Bit laggy at times. One big issue though. Ranks. The system the game has for ranking is based on XP rather than wins, kills or anything else. If you lose a game you still get XP. You get more for winning so if you want a high rank you don't have to be good you simply have to play. I found somebody in the TOP 50 players with only 1 win and 70 kills but he had over 500 games played and so had 9000 XP. I have played 16 and won 16 and I have 80 kills"
Big Big Baller,Liam night,3,6,"Jungle level lags like mad, will keep hole game over this game as it has a solo mode, unlike this, also an advert after every single game? Might aswell stand at an arcade machine feeding it coins, cause that's the digital version of this, each game means money to this company, even hole has its limits it seems after a few games back to back."
Big Big Baller,12_Sara Ibrahim,4,18,I really like this game! It is super cool and nice! It is like hole.io but a better version. But the only reason I rated 4 stars was because when I entered the game today to see how many Frankensteins I got it had 0 even though I swear I've been collecting them all week!!! Plz fix this bug issue. Thanks.
Big Big Baller,A Google user,3,68,"Currently playing the tournament. While I think this game is really fun the errors are kind of irksome. I've been trying to move on to the finals of the tournament having won the semifinals but the game keeps freezing on the nonoptional prize bar. It selects the prize and then doesn't give the option to ""get"" and then the only way to get away from the wheel is to hit back and quit the game altogether. Thus having to redo the semi-final round now for a third time. Please fix. Great game otherwise"
Big Big Baller,S M,1,1,"STOP THE ADS!!! I let my boys download this game ages 8 and 9. The game itself is age appropriate but while they are playing the game every minute a pop up adcomes up. I happened to be looking over my kids shoulders and saw some ads the very last ad I saw before making them DELETE your game was a woman shaking he nasty almost makes a**!now if that were a grown man he would be called a pedophile. My kids are 8 and 9 and who knows how many other kids are seeing these grown women doing this, they are pedophiles in my book! STOP!"
Big Big Baller,A Google user,4,17,This game is enjoyable not to laggy on my phone (s7) I got the 100 win skin but the bad things are too many adds and you can't play with real people. I have a suggestion you could add a team mode (with real people) so like you could add friends to be on your team and another suggestion is connect it with Google play games so people can save there progress if they get a new phone or something when I got my s7 for xmas I had to start all over again from 27 wins to 0
Big Big Baller,Mariana Zulkfli,5,576,"It's a good game. I often get bored with games. But I never get tired with this one. All are good, except the fact that it be more slowly to move when I hit bigger. I'm really appreciate it if that can fix the trouble. Suggestion from me is hopefully this app can add more new Skin. I will keep looking forward it."
Big Big Baller,April Holland,3,329,When I first downloaded this game I loved it but since they have added new maps and extra skins it's very bad about lagging and the controls don't always work properly. I can be in first place and all of a sudden my ball stops moving regardless of where I aim it to go and I end up fourth place because of it. Please fix the issue and I'll change my review.
Big Big Baller,Stefany Rojas,1,3,"Every time I tried to move I would go really fast and idk why I can't say ""ur"" besides, you should add multiple colors that u can change into, like slither.io I would rather play slither.io than this. I would even play the ps1 instead of this. this is really laggy and its not to my liking. I was on 56% and then it turned to 18% WHAT KIND OF HACK ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?!?!?!?"
Big Big Baller,MissionSparta,1,201,"Awful. They want you to believe you are playing against people online, but you are only playing against your phone. Leave the game thirty seconds in...come back five minutes later and the game is exactly where you left. And everyone's names are conveniently Joe, Bob, Cindy, and Sarah. Whatever."
Big Big Baller,Tim Ruston,2,232,Game was good.... Then they added a feature where players could double their size on start up by paying money and the larger size doesn't slow down the player so the large size has a major advantage. As if the ADs every game weren't enough now they're forcing you to waste coins just to play the game hoping you'll spend real money...
Big Big Baller,A Google user,4,5,"I think it's a really good game overall, but when you get bigger in size you get slower, like really slow. So I just wish when you get bigger you stay the same speed as you did when the game first started, now that I'm thinking about it we could be fast in the beginning and go to normal speed when we get bigger. That was just my thoughts.."
Big Big Baller,will hall,3,8,"This game was fun up until the recent update. Before, I was able to win every time almost. Now, after the new update allowing you to double your initial size, I haven't been able to get above 10th. I keep getting caught before I have a chance. In other words, I am not a big fan of the new update."
Big Big Baller,Alley Saylor,2,3,"I'm sorry for who likes this game. This game freezes up a lot, and I mean a lot. Also, please fix freezing and bad controls. As soon as I got this game, I thought I would love it. But I didn't. ‚òπÔ∏è If you guys who ever created this game and fix it, I will download it again and rate it with five üéÜüéÜüéÜüéÜüéÜ's. ( Rate it with five stars thank-you)üë∏"
Big Big Baller,Gillian N.,2,20,"This is VERY similar to the Katamari Damacy series (which is amazing and has games for several consoles), but isn't nearly as good. The speed of the ball is either stationary, or too fast for any sort of precision, with no in between. it also feels vey choppy, not smooth at all. There are ads, which is understandable, but also ways to get ahead by paying. If you have a conpatible console, I reccomend buying one of the Katamari games for a MUCH better experience."
Big Big Baller,Abeer algossabi,5,12,"this game is a wonderful game! it has all fun it needs! it is an amazing game,it also has battle royal where you get bigger then other! for people who are reading this i prefer as this game for you to play!"
Big Big Baller,Stephanie Wiemann,1,5,Was great until they updated it so you can pay to be twice as big as the other players. So now it is completely pay to win. You start a match and immediately get killed by someone who paid to be bigger. You can also now pay to respawn. In a battle Royale game. Terrible.
Big Big Baller,shawn thomas,1,2,I mean it's an okay game it could be way more fun if I could play with just my friends. Like I said you can add an option and feature for that. But way too many ads. and I'll be more than happy to write this 5 stars and delete this one star if it's made for friends just friends as well
Big Big Baller,Tommy Ferry,1,86,"Dreadful user experience. If you don't agree to have your data tracked, the app nags you after every single ""round"", constantly trying to force you agree to targeted ads. Feels like this might be against GDPR regulations? Either way, basically unplayable due to the combination of constant ads and tracking nagging."
Big Big Baller,kimberlycurtsinger72,4,70,"4 1/2 Stars... I absolutely luv this game. there are just a few issues why it's not a 5 stars . First why are the chest in the game. I don't understand when I do get them and even win 1st place I still have to watch an ad or pay 200 to open it. then I will win like 100 to 150 coins, so really what's the point. plus several times it will gl8tch and I'm in tournament mode, and then I lose my place and have to start all the way back over that really sucks, but other then those it's a gr8t game."
Big Big Baller,Eric Robello,3,121,"Too jumpy, the motion is not smooth, hard to control and/or see the field it jumps around so fast. Was hoping for a katamari-style game, but this one needs refining before it could be fun to play."
Big Big Baller,Isaak Meatbag,5,9,Love it but I think you could create online games and solo games and you have to get as much debris as possible like it already is but have infinite time. So then you have to be as quick as possible. Then on the original game you could have 5 mins maybe so 2 mins to get as much stuff as possible then there is a battle royale sort thing after in the same game? Thanks isaak.
Big Big Baller,EarCancer 504,5,224,"I do love this game, however the past couple updates have caused the gameplay to seriously lag. Its probably time for me to upgrade my phone anyway. Since i first downloaded this game i wasnt too into it because of how repetitive it was. but after adding the new maps and battle royal game mode, i enjoy it even more. please fix the laggy gameplay."
Big Big Baller,Arthur Facredyn,1,,"Woah, this game is revolutionary, it's an online multiplayer game, where you don't need an internet connection to play!!! This game is all fake and isn't multiplayer, your just playing against bots, all with names straight of a name book.But I must admit this game is pretty satisfying"
Big Big Baller,MIKELA BURRIES,5,23,The game is a good game to pass time by. Maybe i really like it because i am very good at this game. but it is easy and once you play it a lot you will be able to play it very well to. Give it a try i would recomend. there is also no paying once you are in the game everything you need cost game money so don't worry. enjoy
Big Big Baller,vid kidd,4,207,"Fun game where you roll around a city map accumulating object debris to make your ball as big as possible and roll over all the other players. Only thing I'd recommend to the coders is it would be nice to have an extra minute or so on the classic play clock and then maybe different maps, perhaps based on actual cities?"
Big Big Baller,Tammy Jean,1,343,You are not actually playing against other players. Dont pay attention to the leader boards. They are all fake. They do not provide true info on scores. You never get to play on new maps or get to do different kinds of challenges. Its just the samething over and over.
Big Big Baller,waldo durrant,3,1,"It feels live, but a couple of things have happened that I realise it's not. Closing the game mid match, come back later and you're still on the same map and can immediately get first place. Kinda takes the edge off when the competition isn't immediate."
Big Big Baller,Gabriel N,1,5,"This game world be cool, but I'm 100% sure it's NOT an online game. I can tell because you can name your character ANYTHING, and everyone just names themselves actual names? That's not the internet I know. Also I win every time and other players make stupid decisions and just seem to be rolling around without strategy. Lame ad revenue grab."
Big Big Baller,Brandon Poulsen,3,17,"It is a good looking game, and the gameplay would be fun, except for the controls. I think it has five star potential, but not with the controls as they are now. They need to be tightened up, and much more responsive. I think the developers did a good job, and don't want the tone of this review to take away from my saying it is a nice game. I just want to say what made me stop wanting to play."
Big Big Baller,Chris Felsh,2,68,It's got terrible graphics and the mechanics make little to no sense. Cars go through fallen buildings and you just push things around if you cant absorb it. Hole.io is a superior game in all aspects. Not to mention too many ads. Seriously? One after every game? This game developer is money grubbing way too hard.
Big Big Baller,The Amazing Peeps,5,10,"Hi guys! I just wanted to say,this is a really good game,very fun and,it also has terrific graphics.So please if I were you I would try out this game to see if you like it.But,in my opinion I LOVE it!Let me tell you some good reasons about this amazing game: #1.good controls,it's kind of hard to control at first.But then,you get the hang of it and/get used to it.#2.the graphics are awsome!They make the screen sparkle like majic!Alright I gave you two great reasons why so know bye!"
Big Big Baller,unlovable ¬∑ crackhead ¬∑,2,32,"This app is Hor-rib-ble üò©! First of alll....its the hardest thing to control üéÆ. Its like the game is rigged or something because everytime i try to move, the game takes me where it wants to go and not I üòë. Not only that, but the game makes me move so fast and not in the order I want to go in, my ball is all over the place, meaning that everytime i move i have no idea whats going on because everything is just splattered all over the screen. Plz fix this annoying stuff"
Big Big Baller,Deanna Boyd,1,54,"Great game with one big drawback - the amount that it charges if you want to play ad-free is INSANE. $8/week!! Make it a one time fee dude, that's just ridiculous."
Big Big Baller,Katy Smith,1,392,"Level 29 down to 0???? WT? I played for so long and loves it, until today when all i got to show for my efforts in the championship is nothing!

Im not ecen on the grid how does that work when im a level 29? please just fix tgis bug and get me back where i was, and I'll then be able to update my review. i love this game, please dont make me hate it. thank you."
Big Big Baller,Jasmine Hanning,1,1,"This game is just hole.io but with balls instead of holes. It is trash compared to hole.io because the ""balls"" are just like 10 sided dice. Maybe it is just me but this is just a misleading game (kind of) since like my last comment they are 10 sided dice. Get deleted ""Big Big ;@))√∑="". ;@))√∑= means baller but this game is the opposite if balling."
Big Big Baller,Huy Nguy·ªÖn,5,17,"Addictive but still a bit laggy although the game has potato graphics. The citizens are boring because they don't run away when threats come. Also if you guys add more mode such as multiplayer, solo or even a campain story mode, this game will fire to the top of the chart. Good game Good Jobs üëç"
Big Big Baller,Rob Z,2,74,"Rated at 2 ONLY because it's super fun to crush things (when running smooth). >>BE WARNED < < 1) Purchases / profiles are NOT connected to any account and are device only. 2) Customer service is non-existent. No, that's not exaggeration. 3) Movement & controls clunky/ choppy. 4) Lots of ads. I recommend taking device offline. This greatly reduces lag time and eliminates ads."
Big Big Baller,A Google user,4,241,I love this game but it is to easy. Even my dog can play it and I'm not joking.I win every round and the places run out of things very fast. Please make the game harder. And add a customize your own ball place bc half the skins aren't to nice. thx hope you do the stuff i have said bc it would make the game way better.Thank you.
Big Big Baller,Vampire Heart,1,151,"Has a good concept, like the idea. It is a time waster game, but it lags sooooo bad. The beginning of every game takes forever to get big enough so the lagging won't be as annoying. Even the home screen lags! If it was fixed to where I don't have to put my phone on airplane mode to get it to work right, I would consider redownloading."
Big Big Baller,Hlimi Ralte,4,2,"It's ok no ads so far , but the quality is very bad but it's a good experience with this game. And downlod this it's a very oppropriate game It's very good üëåüëåüòäüëçüëçüëç"
Big Big Baller,Dom746 Playz,4,56,"Its a nice game! To people who say this is not a fair game well lucky you just eat all the small things and youll be fine. One more thing, the reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because I want the devs to make the graphics better and lessen the lag tnx"
Big Big Baller,A Google user,5,49,"Omg, I love this game so much and it is so fun eating everything!! But sometimes it gets out of control just a little bit, I've played it before.. it's very easy to get high scores. I'm sure that if you try out this game, then you will never end up deleting or uninstalling this gameüòóüòóüòó"
Big Big Baller,Lazy Anson,1,2,"This game. Just... Ok, first.. 1. Takes 100MB from my phone! Did not download. My brother recommended it but from reviews I don't want to play it. The screenshots are probably fake. Every game like this probably does that. I think Hole.io is waaay better. 2. The people?üôÑ"
Big Big Baller,Marinus de Beer,1,39,"It's fun to play, but they have ads between every action you do, even between opening up treasure chests. The ads all last for 30 seconds and can't be skipped. So this game receives 1 star. Terrible ads. Would not recommend. The ads take you out of the gameplay and waste too much time."
Big Big Baller,Alexis Kirkland,3,128,"I enjoy this game, but the fun really got sucked out of it once players were given the option to pay coins to start at a larger size. While I understand the desire to profit off the game, this change creates an unfair playing field that makes it extremely difficult for players who don't pay for the size increase to gain their footing at the beginning of the round."
Big Big Baller,Piotr Walczak,4,18,"While the game is fun for a short while, it's limitations are painfully obvious. You keep doing the same thing over and over against AI. There's no multiplayer so the skins are pointless unless you want to brag to the bots. Good time killer for one day or so"
Big Big Baller,Daniel Collins,2,761,"You have accomplished one of the things I absolutely despise: Ads that open programs I DO NOT wish to open. Ads do NOT need to automatically open the app store, as half the time I don't have any intention whatsoever to even LOOK at the advertised content. This is one of my definitions of a virus, manipulating your device without permission."
Big Big Baller,david chisum,5,6,"Edit: can we all agree the double size feature is really stupid? There needs to be a ""revenge"" feature. I go out of my way not to squish other players. But if one of them squishes me, especially if it seems intentional, I will go out of my way to destroy that person. I just squished a guy 5 times outta revenge. Would've been 6 but someone else beat me to the last squishing"
Big Big Baller,A Google user,1,23,Firstly I have some reasons on why THIS IS A STUPID GAME firstly it is so easy just to get last because there is nothing to eat I assume you should add a new map or something secondly the ball goes so fast that it's not even easy to get anything here is some info the bigger you are the faster you are just think about it and lastly you don't even get much money even though you win just make 700 game currency.
Big Big Baller,Benjamin O'Callaghan,3,2,"I think its a good game but its quite hard to get bigger and bigger. When I played it, I payed so I could start bigger than the others and I came 9th! Please do more updates to make you start a bit more bigger than now."
Big Big Baller,Sarah Mohamed,1,100,"What kind of game is this!!!!! It is so slow to move and the first try came in 10th place because of that. before of installing it, it was so anoying for their ads it came twice!!!!!!!üò°üò°üò°"
Big Big Baller,philip grier,5,1,Games should be longer
Big Big Baller,A Google user,1,8,I I think everyone who plays this wins every time... I think that it is rigged to make you think your playing other player when in fact it's just CPU!!! If there's anyone out there that does not win every game speak now!
Big Big Baller,Christian Maher,1,3,"I installed this based on an ad that showed this as a mobile version of Katamari. It's actually a multiplayer game more like hole.io Goodbye. When someone sees that not everyone wants to multiplay everything, n that there is still a very large group of diehard Single player gamers out here, then they will make a mobile version of Katimari, and I will PAY for that. Don't be fooled by the ad."
Big Big Baller,Peeb Peeb,5,15,"Very fun game although I think it is way too easy. After my first play and I learned what to do (no tutorials), I just crush everyone without really even trying. I think 1,000 meters was my largest. Anyone else get that?"
Big Big Baller,Robert Esquibel,4,3,"Very fun. I didn't think I'd like this game because ive tried others similar. Ads aren't too terrible, but please make it to where you can't get killed within 5 seconds of start just because another player rolled over one item. Kinda ruins a lot of the fun."
Big Big Baller,Michelle Kaewchandee,1,17,I absolutely LOVED playing this game up until the last update. While your game loads it asks you to DOUBLE your initial size. Not everyone has the gold or wants to play with that booster. The game begins unfairly now. Sucks since I really enjoyed this game.
Big Big Baller,Rich Macy-Simpson,2,16,"Meh. Cheap knockoff of hole.io, and poorly executed at that. Several complaints, but biggest one is: In hole.io, I can always see what killed me and how. Here, that is frequently untrue. Wishing you better success with your next game. You have potential. ... 2 stars + uninstall"
Big Big Baller,Molly Roberts,5,20,"I really love this game! It is sooo addictive and I can't stop playing it! You have to get it because you will really enjoy it! The only thing I would change is to customise your own skin, make the skins cheaper and add more worlds for you to play in. So good though! ‚ô°"
Big Big Baller,Chasye Hicks,3,202,Hi there I love your game but I think I found a glitch or error. So I was going to buy the 1800 coin pack because I had 1 dollars worth of play store money left. And it said that the 1800 coins where worth $0.99 but when I taped on it said it was $1.99 but I checked the other coin packs and they were all the same as they said they were. But I ain't angry like I said I love this game!!!! üòÉ
Big Big Baller,Kooper Throckmorton,5,532,"I dont know what else to say other than this app is hilarious. theres something so funny about controlling a huge ball that absorbs anything it touches, all the while people and cars dont seem to notice or mind. easy to play, good graphics, fun gameplay, funny to think about. Well done"
Big Big Baller,shaza oza,1,1,I actually tried it and I tried to name myself but it sent me back to the home screen I opened it in then I tried from the other home screen because some devices have a home screen that has a wallpaper and one that has no wallpaper I clicked on the CLASSIC MODE button but it sent me back tried again but the same thing happened why and why...do you want me to play or no uninstalled because of that virus also make the black title screen another thing please and fix this proplem..
Big Big Baller,A Google user,1,10,I had fun for a while but it seems like every time I get a chest I can't open it. it keeps saying wait a couple seconds and try again. Well no matter how long you wait you never get to open the chest. worthless waste of my time. and honestly the game is super easy and just boring
Big Big Baller,Greg,2,115,"I know what you are thinking. ""Finally, an actual katamari clone!"" No, this game is basically a reskin of hole.io with much less features. Not recommended unless you are going to give a review to balance out the positive reviews they probably paid for"
Big Big Baller,Crystal Streaker,1,21,"It was fun till they gave people who watch advertisements an advantage. It is impossible to play battle mode anymore. Any time I start I immediately get squished. I understand it's a good money grab, but it's unplayable now."
Big Big Baller,Chris Bell,3,5,Lovely new style of game. Technique and strategy really pay off. Unfortunately I found out that you are playing against AI players rather than real people. Look for stuttering motion and that's the AI. Shame they hid this.
Big Big Baller,Dobby Jai,3,1,"The game itself is decent, a copy of a classic ps2 game, but truth is that you dont play against real people, you will almost always win. Still a decent game to play for like 2 to 3 weeks. Then it gets boring"
Big Big Baller,Mohd Fariz,2,3,Ads was way too much. Ads almost every time when finish one game and cannot skip.Very annoying. Gameplay was ok not excellent maybe frustrated with so many ads. Hope ads can be reduced abit not too much or else this game will dead.
Big Big Baller,Kevin Nugent,3,10,"While I think it's a pr...ADVERTISEMENT..retty fun game, the ""multiplayer"" asp... ADVERTISEMENT...ect of this game is deceiving. I highly suspect...ADVERTISEMENT...that the other ""players"" are bots. They all have first names rather...ADVERTISEMENT... than aliases."
Big Big Baller,Christopher Johnson,2,60,Game play is OK but the constant adverts make the game unplayable unless you want to spend stupid amounts on a game that does not deserve it. Updates are rare other than profiteering skins that are pointless. Although my biggest concerns are the disturbing privacy settings. Don't want to be tracked and have your life invaded don't play. Turn the privacy settings on and get asked to turn them on constantly. I'm truly saddened that a company takes such an aggressive approach to tracking people!
Big Big Baller,brin jennings,1,11,"I loved this game, I even paid for it, but your extra money grubbing ways made me uninstall this game. You made it so that you have to pay to get the boost others are buying to get bigger. Don't recommend this app at all ever again."
Big Big Baller,Mindy Mair,1,,I really liked the game but it recently changed to where you have to pay coins to get a bigger ball at the start. no money=you can't even move from the starting line. took ALL the fun out.
Big Big Baller,Aleah,2,10,Crazy how I have to watch ads in order to claim a reward... It's not a reward if I have to watch ads to claim it. Oh and too many ads. But overall I think it's a good game. There should be more time added.
Big Big Baller,ShrimpyCakes,2,,"I think its a great game! The idea of the game, and the gameplay! ONE major problem though. Its the LAGGIEST game I have ever played. Pleade fix the lag, and it would be a five star!"
Big Big Baller,Sovereign Beak,3,,"Nice game, but there are a lot of ads, some with a 5 second skip delay, which is really annoying. Also, the 'other players' are most likely bots."
Big Big Baller,BlackSheep,2,,"Was great, until they added the ability to start bigger (for coins).. If you don't, then ninety percent of the time you get wiped out at the start in battle royale mode. Which is all I play."
Big Big Baller,Katie Sivers,4,636,"I absolutely love the concept. Here are my requests is to create different worlds and maybe have ""bonus"" targets that for example, speed u up for a few seconds, create a wall to prevent u from dying etc. Also longer game play as u grow the map. But I love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Big Big Baller,A Google user,3,,This game is awesome sure you do smash things but over all I think of this game as a great time waster I could play this game for 5 hours straight I just love this game all the I said I do love it the graphics are not good its also a little dumb because cars just go through buildings and all you do is roll a ball awful üòíüòíüòíüòí
Big Big Baller,Elena Delves,3,2,"I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and I have played for quite a while, watched ads, etc but nothing is unlocking battle royale on my phone. My partner had no issues and loves battle royale. Would love to have this feature on my game too üòì"
Big Big Baller,Sunshine Marie,2,13,Well I was obsessed with this game until you have an option to buy a cheat by starting as a big guy. I don't see it as a fair competitive game any more. The little guys have zero chance because they start in a cluster. Don't like the update. Uninstalling
Big Big Baller,A Google user,5,8,This game is so addictive first game I played I won so the more u play the harder but super fun at the same time like some games u win then lose then just start winning again the goal is to be in first place. Awesome gameplay.
Big Big Baller,flashgnash,2,6,"The game tricks you into thinking it's multiplayer, even though it doesn't explicitly say it is it makes it feel like multiplayer, but the opponents are just AI which kind of takes the fun out of winning"
Big Big Baller,Patrick Ferrell,3,33,This game is really fun but it charges ridiculous amounts for VIP and other additions like no commercials. There are ONLY 3 maps and you charge $8 a WEEK for VIP to have slightly more interesting skins...sounds like a way to get kids with their parents card numbers to fund a non evolving game.
Big Big Baller,Eric Warncke,5,12,Absolutely love this game. Probably the most fun cellphone game I've ever played. I always loved the katamari concept and this battle royale implementation is fantastic. I hope they continue to make it better and better.
Big Big Baller,A Google user,3,1,"#MULTI-LAG it was ok when I'd played it the first time then it started lagging, exiting the game all of the sudden and I want a normal game where I could be alone in the to eat the world and no timer I want a ""solo"" game mode"
Big Big Baller,Mohammed Rayyan Sonde,4,19,"It is a good game but the developers should add a few features like guns to the ball.As the ball gets bigger ,the weapons are auto upgrade to stronger weapons. Overall it is good and challenging game. Happy with itüòÄ"
Big Big Baller,Stamp Rat,1,87,"I used to play this game a lot, but now I cannot since everytime I open it up and try to play it, it just shows a glitchy image. I can barely see anything and I cannot play it. If it's not doing that for anyone and it's just me then please tell me what I should do fix this. Thank you."
Big Big Baller,Paul Vu,2,3,Playing against bots the whole time.... I started a game and went into airplane mode and things were still moving. Game was fun at first but it seemed strange that players/bots made stupid moves and I would win 99% of the time.
Big Big Baller,A Google user,2,1,"i hate how it has soooo much adds and sooo much stuff happening on the home screen. Also the game lags, i was playing and i died then the game crashed. Its a decent game for a game to use when bored. The new maps was a great update."
Big Big Baller,ksu fan,3,5,Battle Royale would be much better if everyone started in different locations. You get killed almost immediately for most games. I'm uninstalling for this reason alone. Plus way too many ads
Big Big Baller,A Google user,3,3,The thing that's frustrating about this game is how slow you become when you gather quite a bit of stuff.... Just make it maintain that fast speed and it would be so much better!
Big Big Baller,Typical Ape Monkey,1,2,"I honestly have no words for how bad this game is. It has a great concept behind, and huge potential but the developer isn't trying hard enough. Rather not trying at all. It would be better if they gave it to another developer, or if they actually started trying."
Big Big Baller,Haidynn Barton,3,12,So far so.......... BAD i tried to play it and it kept kicking me out it might just be a glich but it is not fun and i just really wanted to play it because i did it on my cosins tablet its fun but when you keep getting logged out its not! üò§
Big Big Baller,Michael Norman,1,5,"Even when purchasing the ads away, they are still in your face constantly. Incredibly pay to win. AND NOT MULTI PLAYER. Put your phone in airplane mode. You're playing against bots."
Big Big Baller,heejin kim,3,,it was fun but i think it needs some more stuff than just a ball getting bigger everytime you pass by something i would rather there be some fun challenges that will make u have fun while playing it more than just crushing other balls and eating the whole town
Big Big Baller,A Google user,5,9,It's amazing racing to be the first person to be the biggest. challenging and addictive because of the mesmerizing fun. Almost no ads on it. I played it 1 hour straight and not even 10 minutes of it were advertisements. SOOOOOOO FUN
Big Big Baller,David Heiman,1,58,It''s a fun game something to do when you're bored. They make it look like your playing with other people but your not and there is no challenge.. I hate when people try to trick me so 1 star. Also crazy amount of ads.
Big Big Baller,RealYt Lance BMGO,2,2,it was fun but...its the graphics is so laggy and i just rated this 2 stars when i played it it was horible so many adds
Big Big Baller,Kristen Hack,2,13,"Was fun until the option to""upgrade"" your ball for 200 coin. Now it's not fun. Just get killed the second you begin. Why should I have to upgrade just to stay in the game. It should be equal for everyone"
Big Big Baller,Matt Cavallo,5,14,Awesome game! I hope the developers continue and add more features to show stats and different game modes. The game is intense but very fun when you win.
Big Big Baller,Wytze TS,1,3,"It's super annoying because other people can start bigger and than you will almost always die in the first seconds of the game, if you want to start bigger either you've got to pay 200 game coins!üò°üò†"
Big Big Baller,Nick Jean,1,2,"Ugh i was so excited when I found this, turns out the game is either offline of very broken, won the first match by a landslide second game I was killed at least twice while in 8th place the entire game and suddenly I'm in 1st and I win the match..."
Big Big Baller,Jeremy Glavac,1,110,"In Offline mode, it kills you automatically if you didn't pay coins. 9 times out of 10 you won't have time to get out of the way and there's a CPU player that will simply roll over you after a fraction of a second."
